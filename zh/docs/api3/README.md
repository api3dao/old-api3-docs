**API3** ([https://api3.org](https://api3.org)) is a collaborative project to deliver traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. It is governed by a _decentralized autonomous organization_ (DAO), namely the **API3 DAO**. Therefore, its code is open source and its operations are transparent.

## Thesis Statement

The vast majority of the external integrations that decentralized applications need are to commercial Web APIs that traditional businesses have built to monetize their data and services.

Therefore, what is widely known as _the oracle problem_ is in practice _an API connectivity problem_.

Existing oracle solutions fall short because they fail to make this distinction, resulting in inferior solutions that depend on third-party oracles and ecosystems that exclude _API providers_. By refining the definition of the problem, **API3** aims to provide a much more optimal solution.

## The Airnode

At its core, **API3** brings the ability for API providers to easily run their own _oracle nodes_. This allows them to provide their data on-chain, without an intermediary, to any _decentralized app_ \(dApp\) interested in their services.

At the heart of this mechanism sits **Airnode**, an open-source oracle node. It's designed to be easily deployed by any API provider with almost no maintenance. Because of Airnode, dApp developers can write _smart contracts_ to interact with the on-chain data of API providers.

Airnode is designed with mechanisms to remove the on-chain or off-chain concerns of API providers. The set-and-forget framework of Airnode is all about ease of implementation.

**Abstract from the
<a href="/api3-whitepaper-v1.0.2.pdf" target="_api3-whitepaper">API3
Whitepaper</a>**

With decentralized applications beginning to provide meaningful services in areas such as decentralized finance, there is an increasing need for these applications to receive data or trigger events using traditional Web APIs.

However, the generic oracle solutions fail to appropriately address the API connectivity problem due to an over-generalized and misguided approach. To remedy this issue, API3 will drive a collaborative effort to create a new generation of blockchain-native, decentralized APIs, or dAPIs for short.

dAPIs are composed of first-party oracles operated by API providers, and thus are more secure and cost-efficient than alternative solutions that employ middlemen. At the core of the governance, security, and value capture mechanics of this initiative will be the API3 token. Staking the token will grant its holders full governing rights over the API3 DAO along with all the associated rewards.

Staked API3 tokens will be used as collateral for the on-chain coverage service that will provide quantifiable and trustless security guarantees to dAPI users. These mechanics will remove the need for a central authority at the ecosystem level. As a result, the API3 Project will allow smart contract platforms to leverage APIs for the building of meaningful applications in a truly decentralized and trust-minimized way.
