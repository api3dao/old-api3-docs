This component warns developers not to run multiple Airnode deployments simultaneously.

Use of .html in the removeLink property for the router-link element is intended.

      Avoid running multiple deployments simultaneously as doing so might result
      in a broken deployment. If this occurs, the standard removal approach may
      not succeed and
      <router-link :to="removeLink">Manual Removal</router-link> may be
      required.
