Consider joining the distributed, highly collaborative Core Development Team at
API3. We are constantly searching for talented individuals who think blockchain
technology is _the big thing_ and want to build a future where off-chain,
real-world data seamlessly interfaces with smart contracts and decentralized
applications.

## We are Builders

The Core Development Team is focused on delivering optimized solutions to
securely, efficiently, and transparently access off-chain data. We are pioneers
in first-party oracle technology that underlies a growing ecosystem of
institutions participating in the Web3 API economy.

In addition to working in public and releasing open source software, the Core
Development Team embraces automation, experimentation, multi-hat roles, high
standards, and supporting one another.

Our compensation is competitive, based on your skills and experience, and paid
in stablecoins. We are fully remote and hire globally.

**What you'll be doing:**

- Full cycle testing: designing, documenting and executing manual tests, and
  scripting automated tests
- Root cause analysis of bugs, test failures and regression testing thereof
- Continuous improvement of the testing tools, test coverage, and automated
  testing environment

  define requirements, behavior and impact
- Recommending system improvements based on the testing experience
- Working closely with the engineers and product owners

**What skills we need you to have:**

- Senior-level professional QA engineering experience testing back-end services
  such as APIs, databases, distributed services (non-monolithic) and Solidity
  smart contracts
- Good understanding of modern testing tools, frameworks and strategies
- Enjoy breaking things and solving problems - not just able to find out the
  'what', but also the 'why'
- A technical scripting ability

  parameters through historical data, preparation of deployment files and
  maintaining a call schedule for implementations
- Designing the Oracle Integrations Process and documenting it from start to end
- Work closely together with other members of the Core Tech Team (from engineers
  to product owners) to manage the relationship with our partners
