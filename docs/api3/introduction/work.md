Consider joining the distributed, highly collaborative Core Development Team at
API3. We are constantly searching for talented individuals who think blockchain
technology is _the big thing_ and want to build a future where off-chain,
real-world data seamlessly interfaces with smart contracts and decentralized
applications.

## We are Builders

The Core Development Team is focused on delivering optimized solutions to
securely, efficiently, and transparently access off-chain data. We are pioneers
in first-party oracle technology that underlies a growing ecosystem of
institutions participating in the Web3 API economy.

In addition to working in public and releasing open source software, the Core
Development Team embraces automation, experimentation, multi-hat roles, high
standards, and supporting one another.

Our compensation is competitive, based on your skills and experience, and paid in stablecoins. We are fully remote and hire globally.
