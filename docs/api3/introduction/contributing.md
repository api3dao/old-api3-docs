(To the API3 DAO as a technical member)

## Prerequisites

This is aimed to guide an API3 DAO member with a technical background to
contribute to the project (through development, integrations, writing
documentation, etc.). The general point is that one needs to be able to use a
solution proficiently before being able to improve it. Therefore, you are
recommended to do all of the below before attempting to contribute, and make
sure to ask any questions you have on
[our Discord](https://discord.gg/qnRrcfnm5W).

- If you do not have any blockchain development experience, read
  [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook) cover to
  cover. It is a light read that touches on all subjects that you will need to
  know about superficially.

- To get a general grasp of the project, read the
  <a href="/api3-whitepaper-v1.0.3.pdf" target="_api3-whitepaper">API3
  Whitepaper</a> and our [blog posts](./symlink-blog-posts.md) on Medium.

- Read the entirety of these docs. Take notes and cross-reference, but do not
  expect to understand everything. Feel free to ask questions.

- Run and understand the Airnode starter tutorial

- (Optional, but ideal) Integrate an API to an Airnode without using any guide,
  deploy the Airnode, and build a dApp that uses the Airnode. Better yet, join
  one of our hackathons.

- (For the curious) Explore all the repos hosted on
  [our GitHub](https://github.com/api3dao), go through the issues, PRs, etc.

This guide will be updated as more materials are produced. Please feel free to
create [issues](https://github.com/api3dao/api3-docs/issues) to make
suggestions.

## Contributing to the docs

See the [dev documentation](/dev/) for an overview of the API3 docs site and for
instructions on how to run the project locally.
