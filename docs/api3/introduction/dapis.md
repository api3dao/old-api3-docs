Consider the following:

- Decentralized applications need access to [APIs](./apis.md)
- APIs should be interfaced to smart contract platforms through
  [first-party oracles](./first-party-oracles.md)
- For API level decentralization,
  [decentrally-governed oracle networks](./decentrally-governed-oracle-networks.md)
  should be employed

It can be concluded that decentrally-governed networks of first-party oracles
solve the API connectivity problem. Although this is technically correct, the
same solution can be reached through a more useful lens.

Decentralized applications cannot access Web APIs, and oracle solutions aim to
build decentralized interfaces to facilitate this. However, this approach
results in an inferior solution and ecosystem (see the
<a href="/api3-whitepaper-v1.0.3.pdf" target="_api3-whitepaper">API3
Whitepaper</a> for a detailed explanation).

Instead, API3 builds complete products called decentralized APIs (dAPIs for
short), which are blockchain-native, decentralized API services. From the user's
(i.e., the entity that operates the decentralized application) perspective, the
experience of using a dAPI would be very similar to a Web developer using a
traditional API; they would find a dAPI they need, pay the subscription fee, and
enjoy access.

Due to being defined as a full product rather than an interface, unlike a
traditional oracle network, a dAPI includes the underlying APIs. This results in
a superior solution (secure and cost-efficient first-party oracles) and
ecosystem (with API providers as its members).
