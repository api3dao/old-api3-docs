Description of all GitHub Actions used in the remote api3dao/api3-docs repo,
[.github/workflows](https://github.com/api3dao/api3-docs/tree/stage/.github/workflows).

## lychee

This action checks all local and external markdown hyperlinks as well as images
(including `<img>` tags) in all production version folders and the _/dev_
folder. While there is a
[lychee-action](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action) on the Action
Marketplace, as of this writing the current release lacked key features.
Instead, this action installs
[lycheeverse/lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee) from a specific
commit and caches that installation for fast execution.

  Action Configuration

## Firebase

The
[firebase-deployment.yml](https://github.com/api3dao/api3-docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/firebase-deployment.yml)
Action provides docs site branch deployments so developers can preview how their
documentation will look once live in production. The Action includes a series of
build and deploy steps followed by a github-script step that comments on the
push commit or PR with the deployment URL. Deployed sites are automatically
deleted after 30 days of inactivity on the branch.

## Scheduled config PR (currently disabled)

To keep the docs current, this daily action pulls config files from the
`airnode` repo and uses the
[peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-pull-request)
marketplace action to automatically create a PR in this repo _if_ the files have
changed. The `matrix` strategy using the variable `vdocs`, for the docs version,
aims to support the addition of future versions without the need for additional
curl commands.
