The default theme for VuePress uses several plugins that are maintained by the
VuePress team. Additionally this project uses plugins developed by the VuePress
community. An attempt has been made to only use community plugins that are
popular and maintained.

All plugins are installed as
[devDependencies](https://github.com/api3dao/api3-docs/blob/main/package.json).

## VuePress Plugins

VuePress plugins are used and some are added by VuePress when a project is
created. They only need to be updated as new releases come forward. The versions
of each should always be in sync (the same). These plugins are not explained
further in this document.

### @vuepress/plugin-back-to-top

Places an up arrow in the bottom right corner that takes the reader to the top
of the current page.

### @vuepress/plugin-last-updated

This plugin is added to the project by the default-theme. By default, this
plugin produces a 13-bit timestamp for each page, you can also pass in a
transformer to convert it to any format that you want.

## Community Plugins

The docs use a few community plugins and packages to enhance the reader
experience and to validate certain content.

- v-click-outside
- vuepress-plugin-element-tabs
- vuepress-plugin-table-of-contents

### Lychee

[Lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee) finds broken hyperlinks, image
src and mail addresses inside Markdown, HTML, reStructuredText, or any other
text file or website. It is available as a CLI utility and as a GitHub Action:
[lycheeverse/lychee-action](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action).

See the [GitHub Action](./github-actions.md) doc for info on its implementation.

### Link Validator

This custom Node.js script uses the following packages to validate links. See
[Link Validator](link-validator.md) to understand and run the script.

- axios
- colors
- file
- oust

### v-click-outside

This community plugin detects clicks outside an element without stopping the
event propagation. It is used in the **.vuepress/components/VersionsModal.vue**
custom component to allow clicks behind to close the modal. Note that
[VersionsModal.vue](./custom-components.md#versions-vue-and-versionsmodal-vue)
is a child component of **Versions.vue**. VersionsModal.vue uses this plugin to
emit an event to Versions.vue that in turn closes the modal.

### vuepress-plugin-element-tabs

This
[community plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuepress-plugin-element-tabs)
is used to add tabs inside markdown files.

### vuepress-plugin-table-of-contents

This community plugin was added to avoid using the VuePress native Table of
Contents which is not properly adding its links to the browser history stack.
This plugin uses the Vue Router for its links which are correctly added to the
browser history. As a result the user experience when going back or forward
through the history stack is accurate to include anchor positions.
