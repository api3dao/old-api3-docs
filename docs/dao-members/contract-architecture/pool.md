The API3 Pool contract is where API3 token holders can stake their tokens to
acquire voting power in the DAO. Stakers receive rewards in API3 tokens and can
optionally delegate their voting power to another user.

::: tip

The DAO pool contract will also be used to pay coverage claims out of the DAO
pool. This functionality not been implemented to-date.

### Depositing, Staking, Unstaking and Withdrawing

| Signature                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `depositRegular(uint256 amount)`                  | Deposits your API3 tokens into the pool. Tokens must be deposited before they can be staked.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `stake(uint256 amount)`                           | Stakes deposited API3 tokens. Staked tokens will earn rewards, grant voting power (and may be slashed if there is a claim on the poolâ€”not yet implemented).                                                                                                       |
| `depositAndStake(address source, uint256 amount)` | Deposits and stakes API3 tokens in one transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `scheduleUnstake(uint256 shares)`                 | Schedules staked tokens to be unstaked. In order to unstake API3 tokens, members must first schedule an unstake and wait the scheduled period before unstaking (currently ~1 week). Tokens scheduled to be unstaked no longer grant voting power or earn rewards. |
| `unstake(address userAddress) returns(uint256)`   | Unstakes API3 tokens, allowing them to be withdrawn from the pool (unstaking and withdrawing are separate steps). Can only be called after scheduling an unstake and waiting the scheduled amount of time.                                                        |
| `withdrawRegular(uint256 amount)`                 | Withdraws your API3 tokens from the Pool contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `unstakeAndWithdraw(address destination)`         | Unstakes and withdraws tokens in one transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
