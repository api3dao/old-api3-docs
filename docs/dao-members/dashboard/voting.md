Staking grants DAO members the ability to vote on proposals. Your voting power
is calculated by the number of tokens you have staked divided by the total
number of tokens staked at the time the proposal was made. This page will show
how to use your voting power to vote on a proposal as well as delegating your
voting power.

## Getting Started

1. Access the [DAO Dashboard](https://dao.api3.org)
2. Click the **Connect Wallet** button in the upper right hand corner and
   connect to your wallet using the mainnet.

<!-------------------------->

## Vote and Delegate

The **Governance** page displays a list of active proposals to vote on and a
link to delegate your voting power.
