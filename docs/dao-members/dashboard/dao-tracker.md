The [DAO Tracker](https://enormous.cloud/dao/api3/tracker/) is a
community-developed tool that provides additional insight into the DAO beyond
what is offered by the intentionally minimalist DAO Dashboard. Its
[open source codebase](https://github.com/EnormousCloud/api3-dao-tracker) was
developed by GitHub user [EnormousCloud](https://github.com/EnormousCloud).

The DAO Tracker features the following pages and content:

1. **Overview** - APR and staking data for current and previous epochs as well
   as a breakdown of API3 token supply by status, for example number tokens
   locked by governance. The overview page also contains a list of API3 smart
   contracts and the circulating supply of API3.

2. **Rewards** - history of staking rewards containing the APR, number of
   members that were staking, API3 staked, and rewards minted of each epoch.

3. **Wallets** - staking participant wallets along with the voting power
   (absolute and percent), ownership, and accrued rewards of each. If the wallet
   has an associated ENS name, that is also shown with the wallet address.

4. **Votings** - pending, executed, and rejected proposals along with the
   percentage votes for and against each.

5. **Treasury** - contract addresses and balances of each API3 DAO treasury.
