::: warning Coverage Services are under development As of July 8th, 2021 the
ClaimsManagers contracts that implements coverage claims have not been
implemented and is scheduled for a later date. :::

To insure against potential system failures, the DAO pool can empower special
`ClaimsManager` contracts to withdraw staked tokens directly. Approved
`ClaimsManager` contracts do this by calling
`payOutClaim(address recipient, uint256 amount)` in the DAO pool contract, which
transfers tokens from the DAO pool to the recipient. When this occurs, the total
number of staked tokens goes down, and pool share value goes down in turn.

_No ClaimsManagers have been implemented or approved by the DAO pool contract as
of July 8th, 2021._
