Use the [airnode-admin](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/tree/v0.3/packages/airnode-admin) Admin CLI tool to interact with Airnode across blockchains. There are commands for both developers (dApp) and API providers. Developers can sponsor [requester](../../concepts/requester.md) contracts and derive [sponsorWallets](../../concepts/sponsor.md#sponsorwallet) for Airnodes. API providers can build [Airnodes](../../concepts/airnode.md) that serve their API data to requester contracts.

::: warning Transaction Gas Costs

Some commands will incur transaction fees. These are per call transaction gas costs and are relatively small. See the [<span style="color:green;">Developer Fees</span>](../../grp-developers/fees.md) doc.

:::

Almost all commands require you to provide a blockchain `providerUrl`. Following are just two examples of many possibilities. See the [Chain Providers](../../concepts/chain-providers.md) doc for more information.

- `https://eth-rinkeby.gateway.pokt.network/v1/lb/<APP_ID>`
- `https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/<KEY>`

The CLI connects to the [AirnodeRrp.sol](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/blob/v0.3/packages/airnode-protocol/contracts/rrp/AirnodeRrp.sol) or the [RequesterAuthorizerWithAirnode.sol](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/blob/v0.3/packages/airnode-protocol/contracts/authorizers/RequesterAuthorizerWithAirnode.sol) contract, which addresses are derived from the current chain. You can optionally specify the contract addresses yourself by providing optional `airnode-rrp` or `requester-authorizer-with-airnode` command argument with the address of the deployed contract on your targeted chain.

Commands that require `mnemonic` will make an on-chain transaction. The application will derive the account from the mnemonic with default ethereum derivation path `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`. You can override this by using the optional parameter `derivation-path` (`m/44'/60'/0'/0/...`). Make sure that the wallet that is associated with the mnemonic is funded on the target chain. The application will not exit until the transaction is confirmed.

## Using npx

View all commands:

```sh
npx @api3/airnode-admin --help
```

View the parameters of a command:

```sh
npx @api3/airnode-admin $COMMAND --help
```

## Using Docker

Use the Admin CLI docker image as an alternative to `npx`:

```sh
docker run api3/airnode-admin:0.3.1 --help
```

View the parameters of a command:

```sh
docker run api3/airnode-admin:0.3.1 $COMMAND --help
```

## SDK

You can also use the package programmatically. The SDK exports respective functions for all CLI commands as well as helper functions for obtaining the contract instance on the targeted chain.

```js
import { sponsorRequester, getAirnodeRrpWithSigner } from '@api3/admin';

// First obtain the contract instance on target chain
const airnodeRrp = await getAirnodeRrpWithSigner(
  mnemonic,
  derivation - path,
  providerUrl,
  airnodeRrpAddress
);
// Pass the contract instance as the first argument to the SDK function
const requester = await sponsorRequester(airnodeRrp, requester);
```

If you plan to use multiple commands it might be tedious to pass the contract instance to every function call. For this reason there is also class based `AdminSdk` which you initialize with `AirnodeRrp` contract only once.

```js
import { AdminSdk } from '@api3/admin';

// First initialize the SDK with AirnodeRrp contract instance.
// You can use static AdminSdk functions or provide your own instance.
const airnodeRrp = await AdminSdk.getAirnodeRrpWithSigner(
  mnemonic,
  derivation - path,
  providerUrl,
  airnodeRrpAddress
);
// Create sdk instance
const adminSdk = new AdminSdk(airnodeRrp);
// Call the method you need
const requester = await adminSdk.sponsorRequester(requester);

// You can switch the contract instance anytime. E.g. if you are using ethers
adminSdk.airnodeRrp = airnodeRrp.connect(someOtherWallet);
```

The SDK will also provide TS typings out of the box. Please, refer to the implementation for more details.

## Sponsors

Commands related to a [sponsor's](../../concepts/sponsor.md) relationships between [requesters](../../concepts/requester.md) and [sponsorWallets](../../concepts/sponsor.md#sponsorwallet) as well as [templates](../../concepts/template.md) used by a sponsor's requesters. Some of these commands connect to the [AirnodeRrp.sol](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/blob/v0.3/packages/airnode-protocol/contracts/rrp/AirnodeRrp.sol) protocol contract where the signer is sponsor account.

- [sponsor-requester](admin-cli.md#sponsor-requester)
- [unsponsor-requester](admin-cli.md#unsponsor-requester)
- [get-sponsor-status](admin-cli.md#get-sponsor-status)
- [derive-sponsor-wallet-address](admin-cli.md#derive-sponsor-wallet-address)
- [create-template](admin-cli.md#create-template)

### `sponsor-requester`

[Sponsors](../../concepts/sponsor.md) a [requester](../../concepts/requester.md) contract so that its requests can be fulfilled by the [sponsorWallet](../../concepts/sponsor.md#sponsorwallet) of an Airnode. The account derived from the `mnemonic` you provide must belong to the sponsor.

Sponsoring a requester and using the returned `sponsorAddress` to derive a `sponsorWallet` for an Airnode creates a [relationship](../../concepts/sponsor.md) between the requester and the Airnode, see the [`derive-sponsor-wallet-address`](admin-cli.md#derive-sponsor-wallet-address) command.

- `provider-url`: A valid blockchain provider URL.
- `sponsor-mnemonic`: A wallet owned by the sponsor. Used to derive a `sponsorAddress` as the default account of the mnemonic unless a `derivation-path` is specified. It's also used to pay gas costs from the mnemonic's default account unless a `derivation-path` is specified.
- `requester-address`: The contract address of the requester to sponsor.
- `airnode-rrp (optional)`: The public address of the AirnodeRrp.sol protocol contract.
- `derivation-path (optional)`: Selects an alternate account to use from the mnemonic rather than the default.

### `verify-airnode-xpub`

Verifies that the `airnode-xpub` belongs to the HDNode with the path `m/44'/60'/0'` of the Airnode wallet. This command checks that the Airnode address can be derived with provided Airnode [xpub](../../concepts/airnode.md#xpub) with default derivation path `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0` and compares it with the `airnode-address`. This command will most likely be used by a [sponsor](../../concepts/sponsor.md) to verify that the xpub belongs to the Airnode before calling the [derive-sponsor-wallet-address](admin-cli.md#derive-sponsor-wallet-address) command.

## Airnodes

Helper commands for a previously deployed Airnode. Some of these commands connect to the AirnodeRrp.sol protocol contract where the signer must be the Airnode wallet.

- [derive-airnode-xpub](admin-cli.md#derive-airnode-xpub)
- [derive-endpoint-id](admin-cli.md#derive-endpoint-id)
- [generate-mnemonic](admin-cli.md#generate-mnemonic)

<divider/>

### `derive-airnode-xpub`

Derives the Airnode extended public key ([xpub](../../concepts/airnode.md#xpub)). This xpub must be announced via off-chain channels because it will be needed to derive a [sponsorWallet](../../concepts/sponsor.md#sponsorwallet) address. See the [derive-sponsor-wallet-address](admin-cli.md#derive-sponsor-wallet-address) command.

- `airnode-mnemonic`: The Airnode mnemonic for which the xpub is to be derived.

### `derive-endpoint-id`

Derives an [endpointId](../deployment-files/config-json.md#triggers) from the OIS title and the endpoint's name. This command uses the convention described in the [triggers](../../grp-providers/guides/build-an-airnode/configuring-airnode.md#triggers) section of the configuring airnode documentation. Add the `endpointId` to the config.json file (`triggers.rrp[n].endpointId`).

- `ois-title`: The title of the OIS from config.json (`ois.title`).
- `endpoint-name`: The name of the endpoint from config.json (`triggers.rrp[n].endpointName`).

### `generate-mnemonic`

Generates a unique mnemonic which can be used to create the [airnode wallet](../../grp-providers/guides/build-an-airnode/configuring-airnode.md#airnodewalletmnemonic).

```sh
npx @api3/airnode-admin generate-mnemonic
```

## RequesterAuthorizerWithAirnode

RequesterAuthorizerWithAirnode contract was written by API3 as an [authorizer](../../concepts/authorization.md) contract that can be used by any Airnode. Airnode owners can use this contract in addition to authorizer contracts they have written themselves.

This authorizer contract can whitelist [requesters](../../concepts/requester.md) where each Airnode is adminned by themselves.

These commands connect to the [RequesterAuthorizerWithAirnode.sol](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/blob/v0.3/packages/airnode-protocol/contracts/authorizers/RequesterAuthorizerWithAirnode.sol) contract.

<divider/>

### `set-whitelist-expiration`

Called by the Airnode wallet or a whitelist expiration setter to set the whitelisting expiration of a requester for the Airnode–endpoint pair. This can hasten expiration in the case the new expiration timestamp is prior to a previously set timestamp.

- `mnemonic`: Used to pay gas costs from the mnemonic's default account unless a `derivation-path` is specified. The mnemonic must be at least an Admin or Airnode wallet.
- `provider-url`: A valid blockchain provider URL.
