<VersionWarning/>

The `aws.env` contains AWS credentials from an IAM user. These credentials are
used by the Docker
[deployer image](../../grp-providers/docker/deployer-image.md) to deploy an
Airnode to AWS. For more details, see the full description of the
[aws.env](../deployment-files/aws-env.md) file.

- Do not place double quotes (") around the value of each variable.
- Variable names cannot contain dashes (-).
