After integrating your API ([API Integration](api-integration.md)) and creating
the configuration files ([Configuring Airnode](configuring-airnode.md)), the
next step is to deploy the Airnode.

::: tip Complete the following before deploying your Airnode.

- [API Integration](api-integration.md)
- [API Security](api-security.md)
- [Configuring Airnode](configuring-airnode.md)
- [Applying Authorization](./apply-auth.md) optional
- [Heartbeat](./heartbeat.md) optional
- [HTTP Gateway](./http-gateway.md) optional

:::

## Deploy with Docker

The recommended way to deploy Airnode is by using the Docker
[deployer image](../../docker/deployer-image.md). This image is simply a wrapper
around the
[deployer CLI](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/tree/v0.3/packages/airnode-deployer).
Try out the [Quick Deploy](../../tutorial/) tutorial if you wish to become
familiar with the deployer image first.

The deployer interacts with a cloud provider to deploy Airnode programmatically,
without requiring you to click through a lot of ever-changing graphical
interfaces. For it to do so, a cloud project setup and credentials are required
and was discussed in
[Configuring an Airnode](./configuring-airnode.md#aws-setup-aws-deployment-only).

## Install Docker

The [deployer image](../../docker/deployer-image.md) is containerized as a
Docker image. This will deploy the Airnode to the cloud provider without the
worry of installing dependencies and is the recommended way to do a deployment.
If you do not already have docker installed go to the
[Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and install it.

## Deployment

At this point your project should resemble the following. The `config.json`,
`secrets.env`, `aws.env` (if deploying to AWS) and `gcp.json` (if deploying to
GCP) files should be ready to go. Other files you may have added are expected
but not used by the deployer image.

```
my-airnode
├── aws.env
├── gcp.json
├── config
│   ├── config.json
│   └── secrets.env
└── output
```

From the root of the project directory run the Docker
[deployer image](../../docker/deployer-image.md) which will deploy the Airnode.
When the deployment has completed a `receipt.json` file will be written to the
`/output` folder. This file contains important configuration information about
the Airnode and is needed to remove the Airnode should the need arise.

### AWS

:::: tabs

::: tab Linux/Mac/WSL2

```
docker run -it --rm \
  --env-file aws.env \
  -e USER_ID=$(id -u) -e GROUP_ID=$(id -g) \
  -v "$(pwd)/config:/app/config" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
  api3/airnode-deployer:0.4.0 deploy
```

:::

::: tab Windows

For Windows, use CMD (and not PowerShell).

```sh
docker run -it --rm ^

  -v "%cd%/config:/app/config" ^
  -v "%cd%/output:/app/output" ^
  api3/airnode-deployer:0.4.0 deploy

  -v "$(pwd)/gcp.json:/app/gcp.json" \
  -v "$(pwd)/config:/app/config" \

  api3/airnode-deployer:0.4.0 deploy
```

When the deployment is complete a `receipt.json` file is placed into the
`/output` folder.

### receipt.json

The `receipt.json` file is a product of a successful deployment. It contains
configuration information for the Airnode and must be used to remove the Airnode
should you choose.

```json
{
  "airnodeWallet": {
    "airnodeAddress": "0xaBd9daAdf32fCd96eE4607bf3d5B31e19a244Cac",
    "airnodeAddressShort": "abd9daa",
    "xpub": "xpub661MyMwAqRbcGHp9uC7...vbeziJwFHuNs"
  },
  "deployment": {
    "airnodeAddressShort": "abd9daa",
    "cloudProvider": {
      "type": "aws",
      "region": "us-east-1"

    "stage": "dev",

  },
  "api": {
    "httpGatewayUrl": "https://6vmx3xp8tj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/test"
  }
}
```

## Testing with HTTP Gateway

::: warning HTTP Gateway Support

As of this release HTTP Gateway is only supported for AWS Airnode deployments.

:::

If you opted to enable the HTTP Gateway it can be used to test the Airnode while
bypassing the chain it was deployed to. There are two examples in other docs
that detail how to do this.

- [HTTP Gateway](./http-gateway.md#using-curl)
- [Quick Deploy AWS](../../tutorial/quick-deploy-aws/#test-the-airnode)

## Removing the Airnode

When the Airnode was deployed a `receipt.json` file was created in the `/output`
folder. This file is needed to remove an Airnode.

### AWS

:::: tabs

::: tab Linux/Mac/WSL2

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
  --env-file aws.env \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
  api3/airnode-deployer:0.4.0 remove -r output/receipt.json
```

:::

::: tab Windows

For Windows, use CMD (and not PowerShell).

```sh
docker run -it --rm ^
  --env-file aws.env ^
  -v "%cd%/output:/app/output" ^
  api3/airnode-deployer:0.4.0 remove -r output/receipt.json
```

### GCP

  -v "$(pwd)/gcp.json:/app/gcp.json" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
  api3/airnode-deployer:0.4.0 remove -r output/receipt.json
```

:::

::: tab Windows

For Windows, use CMD (and not PowerShell).

```sh
docker run -it --rm ^
  -v "%cd%/gcp.json:/app/gcp.json" ^
  -v "%cd%/output:/app/output" ^

## Calling the Airnode

Once the Airnode is deployed, see
[Calling an Airnode](../../../grp-developers/call-an-airnode.md) to learn how
requests are made to it.
