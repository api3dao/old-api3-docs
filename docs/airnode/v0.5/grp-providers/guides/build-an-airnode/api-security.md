Airnode can pass along security information (schemes) when making calls to API
operations. These come in two forms, _authentication security schemes_ such as
`apiKey or http` and _relay security schemes_ which is information extracted
from the request.

## Supported Security Schemes

Each security scheme has a certain type specified by the required `type`
property inside the security scheme definition. The following security scheme
types are supported.

- [apiKey](./api-security.md#apikey)
- [http](./api-security.md#http)
- [relayRequesterAddress](./api-security.md#relayrequesteraddress)
- [relayChainId](./api-security.md#relaychainid)
- [relayChainType](./api-security.md#relaychaintype)
- [relaySponsorAddress](./api-security.md#relaysponsoraddress)
- [relaySponsorWalletAddress](./api-security.md#relaysponsorwalletaddress)

**Authentication Security Schemes**

An Airnode can use the following security scheme types to authenticate itself.
This is different then [Authorization](./apply-auth.md) of requesters to access
the Airnode.

- apiKey
- http (basic & bearer)

**Relay Security Schemes**

In addition to authenticating itself, Airnode can "relay" security information
about a request to an API operation. For relay security schemes you do not
provide any values as they are extracted from the request by Airnode.

- relayRequesterAddress
- relayChainId
- relayChainType

### apiKey

The `apiKey` security scheme type allows you to define an API key for your API.
It is an object which consists of the following fields

- `type` must be `apiKey`
- `in` can be one of the `query`, `header` or `cookie`. This value specifies how
  should the value be sent to your API.

::: warning Using the "query" option

When using the `query` option, the API key will be sent in the request body for
POST requests and in query string for GET requests.

:::

- `name` is the name of the API key that should be sent to your API. For example
  "X-Api-Key".

Scheme definition example:

```json
{
  "requiresXApiKey": {
    "in": "header",
    "type": "apiKey",
    "name": "X-api-key"
  }
}
```

and `apiCredentials` example:

```json
{
  "oisTitle": "Ois Title",
  "securitySchemeName": "requiresXApiKey",
  "securitySchemeValue": "${X_API_KEY}" // interpolated from secrets.env
}
```

### http

The `http` security scheme type allows you to define a `basic` or `bearer`
authentication. It consists of the following fields

- `type` must be `http`
- `scheme` is either `basic` or `bearer`

Scheme definition example:

```json
{
  "requiresBasicAuth": {
    "scheme": "basic",
    "type": "http"
  }
}
```

and `apiCredentials` example:

```json
{
  "oisTitle": "Ois Title",
  "securitySchemeName": "requiresBasicAuth",
  "securitySchemeValue": "${BASE_64_ENCODED_BASIC_AUTH}" // interpolated from secrets.env
}
```

This security scheme will always be sent in the headers. The security scheme
value should be base64 encoded value "username:password" for `basic` auth and
the encoded token for `bearer` auth.

### relayRequesterAddress

The `relayRequesterAddress` security scheme type instructs Airnode to forward
the [requester](../../../concepts/requester.md) address to your API. The scheme
definition is similar to the [`apiKey`](./api-security.md#apikey), however the
`type` must be `relayRequesterAddress`.

Scheme definition example:

```json
{
  "in": "header",
  "type": "relayRequesterAddress",
  "name": "requesterAddress"
}
```

since this value will be relayed by Airnode, there is no `apiCredentials`
definition.

Note that Airnode is just relaying (forwarding) the requester address to your
API and does not perform any additional logic. If you intend to implement some
logic based on the requester, you need to do so in the implementation of your
API.

### relayChainId

The `relayChainId` security scheme type instructs Airnode to forward the chain
id to your API. The scheme definition is similar to the
[`apiKey`](./api-security.md#apikey), however the `type` must be `relayChainId`.

Scheme definition example:

```json
{
  "in": "query",
  "type": "relayChainId",
  "name": "chainId"
}
```

since this value will be relayed by Airnode, there is no `apiCredentials`
definition.

### relayChainType

The `relayChainType` security scheme type instructs Airnode to forward the chain
type to your API. The scheme definition is similar to the
[`apiKey`](./api-security.md#apikey), however the `type` must be
`relayChainType`.

Scheme definition example:

```json
{
  "in": "query",
  "type": "relayChainType",
  "name": "chainType"
}
```

since this value will be relayed by Airnode, there is no `apiCredentials`
definition.

### relaySponsorAddress

The `relaySponsorAddress` security schema type instructs Airnode to forward the
[sponsor address](../../../concepts/sponsor.html#sponsoraddress) to your API.
The schema definition is similar to the [`apiKey`](./api-security.md#apikey),
however the `type` must be `relaySponsorAddress`.

Schema definition example:

```json
{
  "in": "query",
  "type": "relaySponsorAddress",
  "name": "sponsorAddress"
}
```

since this value will be relayed by Airnode, there is no `apiCredentials`
definition.

### relaySponsorWalletAddress

The `relaySponsorWalletAddress` security schema type instructs Airnode to
forward the
[sponsor wallet address](../../../concepts/sponsor.html#sponsorwallet) to your
API. The schema definition is similar to the
[`apiKey`](./api-security.md#apikey), however the `type` must be
`relaySponsorWalletAddress`.

Schema definition example:

```json
{
  "in": "query",
  "type": "relaySponsorWalletAddress",
  "name": "sponsorWalletAddress"
}
```

since this value will be relayed by Airnode, there is no `apiCredentials`
definition.

## Example

OIS security is inspired by OAS security practices. This is implemented using
the security schemes and security field. All supported security schemes are
described in detail in the
[supported security schemes section](./api-security.md#supported-security-schemes).
Working with security schemes can be described in three steps.

1. [Define the security schemes for an OIS](./api-security.md#step-1-define-the-security-schemes-for-an-ois)
2. [Turn on the defined security schemes](./api-security.md#step-2-turn-on-the-defined-security-schemes)
3. [Specify the values for the defined security schemes](./api-security.md#step-3-specify-the-values-for-the-defined-security-schemes)

Following is an example of a partial `config.json` which demonstrates the usage
of security scheme and security field.

```json
{
  "ois": [
    {
      "title": "My OIS title",
      "apiSpecifications": {
        "components": {
          "securitySchemes": {
            "requiresXApiKey": {
              "in": "header",
              "type": "apiKey",
              "name": "X-api-key"
            }
          }
        },
        "security": {
          "requiresXApiKey": []
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "apiCredentials": [
    {
      "oisTitle": "My OIS title",
      "securitySchemeName": "requiresXApiKey",
      "securitySchemeValue": "${X_API_KEY}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step #1: Define the security schemes for an OIS

You use `ois[n].apiSpecifications.components.securitySchemes` to define the
security schemes your API will use. Consider the partial `config.json` above
that declares a security scheme named "requiresXApiKey". This scheme declares
that the API requires an API key that must exist in the HTTP header named
"X-api-key".

### Step #2: Turn on the defined security schemes

When the scheme is defined, it is not turned on by default. You need to
explicitly list the security schemes you intend to use in the `security` field
located in `ois[n].apiSpecifications.security` object. The keys in this object
are the names of security schemes to be used. Use empty array (`[]`) as values
for now.

_Be aware that this step seems like extra work since there is no reason to
define a security scheme that will not be used. However, Airnode may support
[more complex authentication](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#security-requirement-object)
logic in the future and using `[]` allows its implementation without a breaking
change._

### Step #3: Specify the values for the defined security schemes

After defining and turning on a security scheme, it may be unclear what provides
the value and how it is set.

The authentication schemes are intended to be common for the whole OIS and set
by the API provider using `apiCredentials` part of the `config.json`. The
`apiCredentials` is an array which specifies the values for all security schemes
in all OIS definitions. Each element of this array contains the following fields

- `oisTitle` is the title of the OIS for the particular security scheme
- `securitySchemeName` is the name of the security scheme
- `securitySchemeValue` is the actual value that should be used by Airnode when
  making the API request. This value is usually a secret and it is recommended
  to interpolate it from `secrets.env`.

If you want to base your API authentication on dynamic data, for example
[requester](../../../concepts/requester.md) address, you can utilize the "relay"
security schemes [described above](./api-security.md#relayrequesteraddress)
which can forward this data to your API.

::: warning Relay security schemes do not require a scheme value

The "relay" security schemes do not require the value, because it will be
provided (relayed) by Airnode depending on the particular request.

:::

## Using Different Security Schemes

Currently, if you want different API operations to use different security
schemes they must be grouped in different OIS objects based on their common
security schemes. For example, your API has four operations, three require an
API key in the HTTP header, another (public `/ping` endpoint) requires no
security.

- The first three API operations might be in the `ois[0]` object with a security
  scheme named _requiresXApiKey_ of type _apiKey_ as shown above.
- The /ping API operation would be in `ois[1]` which would not have any
  `component.securitySchemes` and `security` would be an empty array.

## Multiple Security Schemes

You can use multiple security schemes (e.g., an API key goes in the header, and
an additional secret goes in the query).

```json
// inside ois[n].apiSpecifications.
"components": {
  "securitySchemes": {
    "requiresXApiKey": {
      "type": "apiKey",
      "in": "header",
      "name": "X-api-key"
    },
    "specificQuerySecret": {
      "type": "apiKey",
      "in": "query",
      "name": "secret"
    }
  }
},
"security": {
  "requiresXApiKey": [],
  "specificQuerySecret": []
}
```

## No Security

If the API you are integrating is publicly accessible, you can set both the
`security schemes` and `security` fields to empty objects.
