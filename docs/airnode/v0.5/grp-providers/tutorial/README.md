# {{$frontmatter.title}}

The tutorials section of the docs provides some simple guides regarding the
setup and use of Airnodes.

The **"Quick"** series of tutorials are simple introductions to setting up an
Airnode. The purpose is to demonstrate what is needed to deploy an Airnode.
Configuration files are provided with only minor changes to be made on your
part.

- **Quick Deploy AWS** or [Deploying Airnode to AWS](./quick-deploy-aws/): This
  guide is a straight forward starter to create an Airnode on AWS. This
  deployment type is a typical production environment.

- **Quick Deploy GCP** or [Deploying Airnode to GCP](./quick-deploy-gcp/): This
  guide is a straight forward starter to create an Airnode on GCP. This
  deployment type is a typical production environment.

- **Quick Deploy Container** or
  [Deploying Airnode to a Docker Container](./quick-deploy-container/): This
  guide is a straight forward starter to create an Airnode locally in a Docker
  container. This deployment type is a typical development environment although
  self hosted Docker containers can be used for production environments.

::: tip Additional Examples

There are additional examples of Airnode deployments in the
[examples package](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/tree/v0.3/packages/airnode-examples)
of the Airnode repo.

- Run Airnode as a docker container locally while connected to Rinkeby network.
- Run Airnode as a docker container locally, but connected to the hardhat
