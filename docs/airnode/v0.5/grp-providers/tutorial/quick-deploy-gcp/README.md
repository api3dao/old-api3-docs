This demo is a simple Airnode deployment, using a hands-on approach, to better
understand the overall deployment process of the Airnode
[deployer image](../../../grp-providers/docker/deployer-image.md) which deploys
the off-chain component of Airnode (a.k.a., the node) to GCP. It uses an API
endpoint (`GET /coins/{id}`) from
[CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) which returns the
current value of a coin. This demo does not detail the overall configuration of
an Airnode, it is just a quick start.

An Airnode cloud provider deployment uses a Docker image (called
[deployer image](../../../grp-providers/docker/deployer-image.md)) which in turn
requires three files as input.

- [config.json](./config-json.md)
- [secrets.env](./secrets-env.md)
- gcp.json

For the purpose of this demo these files have been created and only require a
few minor changes on your part to make the deployment of the demo Airnode
successful. These changes are needed to supply a GCP project ID, chain provider
url, and a mnemonic.

## Install Prerequisites

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if it is not present on
  your system and launch it
- Install [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

## Project Folder

A project folder is needed for this demo. You can create it manually or download
a zip file ready to go.

:::: tabs

::: tab Create Manually

Create a folder called `/quick-deploy-gcp` with two more internal folders named
`/config` and `/output`. Place the contents of the files provided
([config.json](./config-json.md) and [secrets.env](./secrets-env.md)) into the
locations show below.

```
quick-deploy-gcp
├── config
│   ├── config.json
│   └── secrets.env
└── output
```

:::

::: tab Download

Download the <a href="/zip-files/quick-deploy-gcp-v0.4.zip" download>
quick-deploy-gcp</a> project folder.

## Configuration

Prepare the configuration files, setup a GCP project and obtain credentials. By
default, the deployer image looks for `config.json` and `secrets.env` in
`/config` and writes `receipt.json` to the `/output` folder.

### config.json

This file requires no changes on your part. It has been created with just one
API endpoint. It will instruct the Airnode to attach to the Rinkeby test
network. There are three variables this file will extract (interpolation) from
`secrets.env`.

### secrets.env

Add values for each of the these fields.

- `CHAIN_PROVIDER_URL`: A chain provider url from a provider such as
  [Infura](https://infura.io/). Make sure the provider url you use is for the
  Rinkeby test network. Using another chain provider other than Infura is
  acceptable.

  - Sign-up or login to Infura.
  - Create a new project, select the **Settings** tab in the project.
  - Copy the URL (https) for Rinkeby under the Endpoints pick list.

- `AIRNODE_WALLET_MNEMONIC`: Provide the seed phrase (mnemonic) to a digital
  wallet. For the purpose of this demo it does not need eth in it for the
  Rinkeby test network. If you don't have one use the Admin CLI command
  [generate-mnemonic](../../../reference/packages/admin-cli.md#generate-mnemonic)
  to create one or another method you prefer.

- `PROJECT_ID`: Project ID of your GCP project.
  [Create a GCP project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
  under which will the Airnode be deployed and copy the project ID.

### GCP Project Setup & Credentials

First, you need to
[create a GCP project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
under which will the Airnode be deployed. Once the project is created, insert
its project ID into your
[config.json](../../guides/build-an-airnode/configuring-airnode.md#cloudprovider).

In order for Airnode to deploy successfully, you need to enable
[App Engine Admin API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/appengine.googleapis.com)
for your GCP project. After enabling it, wait a few minutes before the
deployment itself so the change will take place.

Create a new service account from the
[Service accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
menu. Grant this service account access to the project by adding a role `Owner`
during the creation process.

Once the account is created, add a new access key of type JSON for this account.
Download the key file as `gcp.json` under the main `/quick-deploy-gcp`
directory.

## Deploy

Make sure Docker is running and then execute the deployer image from the root of
the `quick-deploy-gcp` folder. A `receipt.json` file will be created upon
completion. It contains some deployment information and is used to remove the
Airnode.

<DeployerPermissionsWarning/>

Run the following command to deploy the demo Airnode. Note that the version of
`api3/airnode-deployer` matches the `nodeVersion` in the config.json file.

:::: tabs

::: tab Linux/Mac/WSL2

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
  -e USER_ID=$(id -u) -e GROUP_ID=$(id -g) \
  -v "$(pwd)/gcp.json:/app/gcp.json" \
  -v "$(pwd)/config:/app/config" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
  api3/airnode-deployer:0.4.0 deploy
```

:::

::: tab Windows

For Windows, use CMD (and not PowerShell).

```sh
docker run -it --rm ^
  -v "%cd%/gcp.json:/app/gcp.json" ^
  -v "%cd%/config:/app/config" ^
  -v "%cd%/output:/app/output" ^
  api3/airnode-deployer:0.4.0 deploy
```

:::

::::

## Confirm the Airnode Deployment

After a successful deployment you can see the Airnode logs in your
[GCP Logs Explorer](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs). If you can see logs
like

```
INFO Coordinator starting...
...
INFO Pending requests: 0 API call(s), 0 withdrawal(s)
...
INFO Coordinator completed
```

the Airnode is up and running.

<!-- Not really sure what else to put here. HTTP gateway is not available for GCP -->

## Remove the Airnode

When you are done with this demo you can remove it. When the Airnode was
deployed a `receipt.json` file was created in the `/output` folder. This file is
needed to remove an Airnode.

:::: tabs

::: tab Linux/Mac/WSL2

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/gcp.json:/app/gcp.json" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
  api3/airnode-deployer:0.4.0 remove -r output/receipt.json
```

:::

::: tab Windows

For Windows, use CMD (and not PowerShell).

```sh
docker run -it --rm ^
  -v "%cd%/gcp.json:/app/gcp.json" ^
  -v "%cd%/output:/app/output" ^
  api3/airnode-deployer:0.4.0 remove -r output/receipt.json
```

## Summary

You have deployed an Airnode on GCP. The Airnode, upon deployment, started
contacting the AirnodeRrp contract on the Rinkeby testnet to gather any requests
made by requesters to this Airnode. This tutorial did not address making a
request as its purpose was simply to quickly deploy a functional Airnode.
