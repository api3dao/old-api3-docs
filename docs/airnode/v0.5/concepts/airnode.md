Airnode is a serverless oracle node implemented with a _"set and forget"_
[philosophy](../grp-providers/airnode/design-philosophy.md).

<!-- TODO: Link why should you use Airnode -->

Airnode is capable of serving one or more APIs to it's
[requesters](./requester.md) which are smart contracts on chain who request the
data server by the particular Airnode. Each Airnode has a
[unique mnemonic](../grp-providers/guides/build-an-airnode/configuring-airnode.md#airnodewalletmnemonic)
identifying its wallet. This mnemonic is kept in secret and Airnode is publicly
identified using the default [address](airnode.md#airnodeaddress) derived from
the mnemonic.

## `airnodeAddress`

An Airnode is identified by the default address of a BIP 44 wallet (with the
path `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`). This address is same for all chains on which Airnode
operates. You specify the wallet mnemonic in the
[`secrets.env`](../grp-providers/guides/build-an-airnode/configuring-airnode.md#creating-secrets-env)
file which you use when deploying the Airnode.

You can also use ethers.js to derive the `airnodeAddress` from the mnemonic for
informational purposes.

<!-- TODO: This should probably be supported in the admin CLI package -->

```js
// Get the default address of the airnode-wallet using its mnemonic.
airnodeHdNode = ethers.utils.HDNode.fromMnemonic(mnemonic);
airnodeAddress = airnodeHdNode.address;
```

## `xpub`

The Airnode owner announces their extended public key (`xpub` of the hardened
derivation path `m/44'/60'/0'`) off-chain for sponsors to be able to derive
their [sponsor wallets](sponsor.md#sponsorwallet). This wallet will then be used
by the Airnode to fulfill each request made by the requester contracts. The
`xpub` that the owner has announced is not verified on-chain.

However, the sponsor can verify it off-chain. You can use the
[`verify-xpub`](../reference/packages/admin-cli.md#verify-airnode-xpub) command
from the admin CLI.
