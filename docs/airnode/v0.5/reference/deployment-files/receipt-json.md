<TitleSpan>Deployment Files</TitleSpan>

# {{$frontmatter.title}}

A `receipt.json` file is outputted after each deployment and contains
non-sensitive information about the deployment. The main use of a receipt file
is to remove an Airnode deployment when no longer needed. Use the
[docker image](../../grp-providers/docker/deployer-image.md#remove) to execute
the remove command.

It also provides the Airnode xpub for the hardened derivation path
`m/44'/60'/0'` that must be announced off-chain in order for sponsors to derive
their designated sponsor wallet. This wallet will then be used by the Airnode to
fulfill each request made by the requester contracts.

- `airnodeWallet`: describes the Airnode that was deployed
- `deployment`: where the Airnode was deployed to
- `api`: contains the details of the Airnode API (e.g.
  [heartbeat](../../grp-providers/guides/build-an-airnode/heartbeat.md) or
  [testing gateway](../../grp-providers/guides/build-an-airnode/http-gateway.md))

A `receipt.json` file is created for both a AWS or GCP deployment. A receipt is
not generated for client deployments (deploying to a Docker container).
