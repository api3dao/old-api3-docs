The `ois` JSON object, in the `config.json` file that defines an Airnode, is an integral part of an Airnode's understanding of an API's specification and its endpoints. OIS provide a description of API endpoints and maps Airnode endpoints to them. There can be more than one OIS object in the `config.json` file as Airnode can serve endpoints from more than one API.
