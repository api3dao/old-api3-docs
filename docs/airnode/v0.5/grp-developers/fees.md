There are some one-time setup/maintenance costs and the ongoing costs to call an
Airnode. The Airnode protocol is designed in a way that the requester assumes
all gas costs, including the request fulfillment (response) transactions.

## Sponsors

Fees are encountered when a sponsor engages in setup activity such as sponsoring
a requester. These are per call transaction gas costs and are relatively small.
Funds will come from the wallet mnemonic that the sponsor supplies when calling
certain [admin commands](../reference/packages/admin-cli.md) as shown below.

- [sponsor-requester](../reference/packages/admin-cli.md#sponsor-requester)
- [unsponsor-requester](../reference/packages/admin-cli.md#unsponsor-requester)
- [create-template](../reference/packages/admin-cli.md#create-template)
- [request-withdrawal](../reference/packages/admin-cli.md#request-withdrawal)

## Airnodes

Fees are encountered, as transaction gas costs, when funding a requester's
sponsor wallet for an Airnode and when executing the Airnode in response to a
request.

- Funding a sponsor wallet associated with an Airnode: A sponsor wallet is
  funded manually by a sponsor using their preferred wallet management tool such
  as MetaMask.

- [Calling](../grp-developers/call-an-airnode.md) an Airnode: Transaction gas
  fees are withdrawn from the sponsor wallet related to the Airnode being called
  by a sponsored requester.

section.

## API Provider Fees

Some API providers charge a subscription fee to access their data. This is a
typical practice and usually requires the requester to create an account on a
website and then subscribe to a level of service offered. These types of
services are usually billed monthly and can be based on an annual rate to save
costs. The subscription (even if free) will most likely involve the use of a
security scheme such as an api-key that must be used to access the data. See
[Calling an Airnode](call-an-airnode.md) to learn more on how to pass the
security credentials to an Airnode.
