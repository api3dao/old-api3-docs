As part of the Airnode deployment you can decide to deploy two different HTTP
Gateways.

- HTTP Gateway: testing
- HTTP Signed Data Gateway: production use

## Gateway Differences

Both gateways are setup identically. The differences are in their purpose and
response. Gateways are allowed only when deploying to AWS and GCP.

### HTTP Gateway

The regular HTTP gateway is strictly for testing purposes. Using a simple tool
like CURL you can test that endpoints in the Airnode configuration are working
properly without accessing the blockchain.

### HTTP Signed Data Gateway

The HTTP signed data gateway is used for production purposes. While it is
executed in a similar way as the HTTP gateway, its response is signed and does
not contain a `rawValue` field. This gateway is executed by an off-chain code
source that may in turn push data to a blockchain.

## Setup

Enable either gateway in the `config.json` file fields
`nodeSettings.httpGateway` and `nodeSettings.httpSignedDataGateway`.

- **enabled**: A boolean to enable/disable for the gateway.
- **apiKey**: A user defined API key to authenticate against the gateway. The
  key must have a length of between 30 - 120 characters.
- **maxConcurrency**: (optional) A number higher than zero that represents the
  maximum number of serverless functions serving gateway requests. When omitted,
  there is no maximum concurrency set.

```json
"nodeSettings": {
  "cloudProvider": {
    "type": "aws",
    "region": "us-east-1"
  },
  "airnodeWalletMnemonic": "${AIRNODE_WALLET_MNEMONIC}",
  "heartbeat": {...},
  "httpGateway": {
    "enabled": true,
    "apiKey": "${HTTP_GATEWAY_API_KEY}",
    "maxConcurrency": 20
  },
  "httpSignedDataGateway": {
    "enabled": true,
    "apiKey": "${HTTP_SIGNED_DATA_GATEWAY_API_KEY}",
    "maxConcurrency": 20
  },
  ...
},
```

Add the desired endpoints the gateways can respond to in the `triggers.http[n]`
and/or `triggers.httpSignedData[n]` arrays. The corresponding arrays do not need
to match. You may want to test all endpoints but only serve certain endpoints
using the HTTP signed data gateway or via RRP.

```json
// in config.json
"triggers": {
  "rrp": [
    {
      "endpointId": "0xf466b8feec41e9e50815e0c9dca4db1ff959637e564bb13fefa99e9f9f90453c",
      "oisTitle": "CoinGecko Basic Request",
      "endpointName": "coinMarketData",
    }
  ],
  "http": [
    {
      "endpointId": "0xf466b8feec41e9e50815e0c9dca4db1ff959637e564bb13fefa99e9f9f90453c",
      "oisTitle": "CoinGecko Basic Request",
      "endpointName": "coinMarketData",
    }
  ],
  "httpSignedData": [
    {
      "endpointId": "0xf466b8feec41e9e50815e0c9dca4db1ff959637e564bb13fefa99e9f9f90453c",
      "oisTitle": "CoinGecko Basic Request",
      "endpointName": "coinMarketData",
    }
  ]
}
```

## Gateway URLs

A gateway URL is generated for each gateway (when enabled) when Airnode is
deployed. You can obtain the URLs `api.httpGatewayUrl` and
`api.httpSignedDataGatewayUrl` from the
[receipt.json](../../../reference/deployment-files/receipt-json.md) file
returned by the Airnode deployer. They are also available as part of the payload
sent from Airnode's [heartbeat](./heartbeat.md) to your specified heartbeat URL.

## Using CURL

In order to execute an endpoint served by either gateway, the following are
required as part of the CURL call.

- Make a POST request with the `endpointId` as a path parameter. An `endpointId`
  can found in config.json under `triggers.http.endpointId` or
  `triggers.httpSignedData.endpointId`.
- Add the `Content-Type` header, set to `application/json`.
- Add the `x-api-key` header, set to the apiKey. The `x-api-key` can found in
  config.json under `nodeSettings.httpGateway.apiKey` or
  `nodeSettings.httpSignedDataGateway.apiKey`.
- Place the parameters/encodedParameters in the request body.

| \* encodedParameters<div class="tSmall">HTTP Signed Data Gateway</div> | body   | `-d '{"encodedParameters": "0x3173737300....000"}'`       |

\* Parameters for the gateways are named differently. The HTTP signed data
gateway requires that the `encodedParameters` be encoded using
[Airnode ABI](../../../reference/specifications/airnode-abi-specifications.md).

Replace `<gatewayUrl>` in the examples below with a URL from the `receipt.json`
file using the `httpGatewayUrl` or `httpSignedDataGatewayUrl` field. The
[receipt.json](../../../reference/deployment-files/receipt-json.md) file is
created when you deploy an Airnode.

### Response

:::: tabs

::: tab HTTP Gateway

```json
{
  "rawValue": { "usd": "6421.4" },
  "encodedValue": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ef373e180",
  "values": ["64214000000"]
}
```

The response format is a simple JSON object with the following fields:

- `rawValue` - the API response
- `values` - an array of values after they are
  [extracted and converted](../../../reference/packages/adapter.md#conversion)
  to the target type
- `encodedValue` - the encoded bytes value that is sent as payload in the
  response transaction on chain

:::

::: tab HTTP Signed Data Gateway

```json
{
  "timestamp": "1648226003",
  "value": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a571a14c0",
  "signature": "0xa74e4312e2e6fa2de2997ef43e417e3b82d0019ac2a84012300f706f8b213e0d6e1ae9301052ec25b71addae1b1bceb4617779abfc6acd5a951e20a0aaabe6f61b"
}
```

The response format is a simple JSON object with the following fields:

- `data.timestamp` - The timestamp applied to the response.
- `data.value` - The encoded bytes value that is sent as payload in the
  response. Suitable for use on-chain.
- `signature` - The response has been signed by Airnode.

There are additional examples of using CURL to call the HTTP gateway in both the
[Quick Deploy AWS](../../tutorial/quick-deploy-aws/#execute-endpoint) and
[Quick Deploy GCP](../../tutorial/quick-deploy-gcp/#execute-endpoint) tutorials.
