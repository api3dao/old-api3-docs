A sponsor is an entity (individual, business, etc.). Sponsors create
relationships between [requesters](requester.md) and
[sponsorWallets](sponsor.md#sponsorwallet). They do so by sponsoring requesters
and deriving sponsorWallets for Airnodes they want their requesters to call.

> ![relationships](../assets/images/concepts-sponsor-relationships.png)

Making the relationship:

- A sponsor "sponsors" a requester.
- A sponsor "derives" a [sponsorWallet](sponsor.md#sponsorwallet) for a desired
  Airnode.

Making a request.

1. The now "sponsored" requester makes a [request](request.md) of an Airnode.
   Parameters passed to the Airnode include the `sponsorAddress` and the
   `sponsorWalletAddress`.
2. The Airnode verifies that the sponsor of the requester is the sponsor that
   derived the `sponsorWallet` associated with the Airnode.
3. The Airnode uses the respective sponsor's `sponsorWallet` to fulfill the
   request, meaning that the sponsor covers the gas cost.

How a requester refers to the sponsor.

1. A requester can have multiple sponsors that have sponsored it. While making a
   request, the requester provides the `sponsorAddress` that it wants to have
   the request fulfilled by. The AirnodeRrp.sol protocol contract checks if the
   requester is sponsored, and if so, emits the request event.

2. Next Airnode derives the `sponsorWallet` address using the provided
   `sponsorAddress`, then checks if this matches `sponsorWallet`. Airnode will
   ignore the request if the two do not match. This is done this way because
   deriving the `sponsorWallet` address from the `sponsorAddress` on-chain is
   not feasible.

## sponsorAddress

A sponsor is identified by a `sponsorAddress` which is usually the default
account `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0` of a BIP 44 wallet owned by the sponsor. The sponsor
can use a different address from the wallet if desired such as
`m/44'/60'/0'/0/2`.

Note that a sponsor could use multiple addresses from multiple wallets. Below
are some example reasons why one would want to have multiple `sponsorAddress`
identities on-chain:

- To keep separate `sponsor-wallets` for two separate use-cases for easier
  accounting.
- To duplicate transaction queues for a single use-case and increase response
  throughput.

## sponsorWallet

Each [Airnode](airnode.md) can keep a unique`sponsorWallet` for a sponsor. The
wallet is identified by a `sponsorAddress/airnodeAddress` pair. A sponsor must
take action to [derive](#derive-a-sponsor-wallet) a `sponsorWallet` for a
particular Airnode. [Requesters](requester.md), that have been sponsored by a
sponsor, can specify their requests be fulfilled by the `sponsorWallet`
designated to the sponsor. This allows the sponsor to cover the gas cost of
request fulfillments by the Airnode since the sponsor must send funds to this
wallet before making the request.

### Derivation Path

Each sponsor is identified by a `sponsorAddress`, and their sponsor wallets are
designated implicitly by a derivation path. The derivation path for a
`sponsorWallet` starts with `m/44'/60'/0'/0/...` The zero here is allocated for
RRP, and the other branches will be used to derive the sponsor wallets for other
protocols such as PSP.

The path of a `sponsorWallet` for the request–response protocol is
`m/44'/60'/0'/0/${sponsorAddress}`. Other branches such as `m/44'/60'/0'/1/...`,
`m/44'/60'/0'/2/...`, etc. are reserved for other protocols (e.g., the pub–sub
protocol).

An Ethereum address is 20 bytes-long, which makes 160 bits. Each index in the HD
wallet non-hardened derivation path goes up to 2^31. This requires the division
of these 160 bits into six 31 bit-long chunks, therefore derivation path for a
sponsor wallet of a requester would be:

```sh
m/44'/60'/0'/0/...
  /1st least significant 31-bits of the sponsor address (sponsor && 0x7FFFFFFF)…
  /2nd least significant 31-bits of the sponsor address (sponsor >> 31 && 0x7FFFFFFF)…
  /3rd least significant 31-bits of the sponsor address (sponsor >> 62 && 0x7FFFFFFF)…
  /4th least significant 31-bits of the sponsor address (sponsor >> 93 && 0x7FFFFFFF)…
  /5th least significant 31-bits of the sponsor address (sponsor >> 124 && 0x7FFFFFFF)…
  /6th least significant 31-bits of the sponsor address (sponsor >> 155 && 0x7FFFFFFF)
```

Anyone can use the xpub that the Airnode has announced (through off-chain
channels) and the sponsor's `sponsorAddress` to derive a `sponsorWalletAddress`
for a specific Airnode–sponsor pair. In other words, a sponsor can calculate the
address of their respective sponsor wallet for an Airnode and have requesters
use it to make requests right away.

### Gas Costs

Although the `sponsorWallet` scheme allows the sponsor to cover the fulfillment
gas costs, it is just as easy to have the Airnode cover the gas costs. In this
case the Airnode funds the `sponsorWallet`, instead of the sponsor. Furthermore,
this scheme allows hybrid use-cases where the Airnode covers the fulfillment gas
costs for one sponsor (e.g., because they have made a special service agreement
with them), while requiring others to cover their own fulfillment gas costs.

### Trusting the `sponsorWallet`

<airnode-SponsorWalletWarning/>

The risk mentioned above becomes negligible when:

1. The Airnode is a first-party oracle, because first-party oracles are
   trustworthy
2. The Airnode is being used for a high value use-case, which already implies a
   high level of trust

If the sponsor does not trust the Airnode at all, they can fund the sponsor
wallet just enough to cover a single fulfillment for each request to the
Airnode. Therefore, this scheme both supports the traditional per-call payments,
but also allows the protocol to leverage the trustworthiness of Airnodes to
reduce unnecessary gas costs caused by microtransactions.

### Withdrawals

If the sponsor decides not to use a particular `sponsorWallet` going forward,
they can make a request to withdraw funds from it, see the
[`request-withdrawal`](../reference/packages/admin-cli-commands.md#request-withdrawal)
command. The Airnode listens for withdrawal requests and fulfills them
automatically. Therefore, the sponsor should be able to receive their funds from
their `sponsorWallet` in a few minutes notice. The `sponsorWallet` does not get
deleted, and can be used in the future simply by funding it again.

## Sponsoring a Requester

A sponsor uses a `sponsorAddress` and there the requester's on-chain
`requesterAddress` when sponsoring a requester. This sponsorship allows the
requester to use the sponsor's `sponsorWallet` at a particular Airnode to cover
gas costs incurred by the Airnode in response to a request.

Use the
[Admin CLI tool](../reference/packages/admin-cli-commands.md#sponsor-requester)
to sponsor a requester. An example can be seem in the
[Requesters and Sponsors](../grp-developers/requesters-sponsors.md#how-to-sponsor-a-requester)
doc.

## Derive a Sponsor Wallet

When a sponsor wishes to access an Airnode (via a requester) it must create a
`sponsorWallet` for the Airnode. Requesters that have been sponsored by the same
sponsor, can specify their requests be fulfilled by the `sponsorWallet`
belonging to the sponsor. A sponsor uses a
[`sponsorAddress`](sponsor.md#sponsoraddress) and the [`xpub`](airnode.md#xpub)
of a particular Airnode to derive a [sponsorWallet](#sponsorwallet) for the
Airnode. The sponsor must also provide the
[`airnodeAddress`](airnode.md#airnodeaddress) because it will be used to verify
that the provided xpub belongs to the Airnode wallet before deriving a child
sponsor wallet address.

Use the
[Admin CLI tool](../reference/packages/admin-cli-commands.md#derive-sponsor-wallet-address)
to derive a `sponsorWallet`. An example can be seem in the
[Requesters and Sponsors](../grp-developers/requesters-sponsors.md#how-to-derive-a-sponsor-wallet)
doc.
