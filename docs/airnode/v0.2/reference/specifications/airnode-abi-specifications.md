[Contract application binary interface (ABI)](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.6.12/abi-spec.html)
is used to encode different types of data while interacting with Ethereum
contracts. As a result, both Solidity and modules such as
[web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) and
[ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) treat ABI encoding‚Äìdecoding functionality
as a first-class citizen. This makes using contract ABI for encoding API call
parameters a very attractive option.

Although encoding API call parameters using contract ABI has many advantages, it
cannot be used for this purpose directly. Quoting from the
[Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.6.12/abi-spec.html):

> The encoding is not self describing and thus requires a schema in order to
> decode.

This means that when passing API call parameters (of type `bytes`), you would
also need to pass a list of the types for these parameters, which is cumbersome
and it is not clear how these types would be encoded. As a solution, Airnode
uses _Airnode ABI specifications_, an extension of contract ABI specifications
that includes a header that keeps the schema.

## Header

The Airnode ABI specifications header is of type `bytes32` and acts as the
schema (i.e., describes the types of the API call parameters). The header is
encoded in UTF-8 for ease of use. Here is an example:

```
"1BSabiuBa"
```

The first character, `1`, represents the encoding version. Each following
character represents the type of an API call parameter.

### Type encodings

The types are encoded in UTF-8 characters as follows:

```
B: bytes
S: string
a: address
u: uint256
i: int256
b: bytes32
```

Note that dynamically-sized types are represented with uppercase letters, and
statically-sized types are represented with lowercase letters.

## Encoding format

Airnode ABI specifications has the following encoding format (which is somewhat
similar to [SDS](https://github.com/antirez/sds)):

```
[------------------------][-----------------------------------------]
  Header of type bytes32      API call parameter name‚Äìvalue pairs
```

Note that each API call parameter is preceded with a name of type `bytes32`.

## Example encoding

To encode the following API call parameters

```json
{
  "MyFirstBytes": "0x1234",
  "MyString": "1234",
  "MyFirstAddress": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001234",
  "MyBytes32": "1234",
  "MyInt256": "-1234",
  "MyUint256": "1234",
  "MySecondBytes": "0x5678",
  "MySecondAddress": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000005678"
}
```

you would do this in a requester contract as:

```solidity
bytes memory parameters = abi.encode(
    bytes32("1BSabiuBa"),
    bytes32("MyFirstBytes"), bytes(hex"1234"),
    bytes32("MyString"), "1234",
    bytes32("MyFirstAddress"), 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001234,
    bytes32("MyBytes32"), bytes32("1234"),
    bytes32("MyInt256"), -1234,
    bytes32("MyUint256"), 1234,
    bytes32("MySecondBytes"), bytes(hex"5678"),
    bytes32("MySecondAddress"), 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000005678
);
```

Note that you do not need to add an external library to the contract, and
`abi.encode()` is fairly cheap in terms of gas usage (compared to alternative
encoding methods).

## Example decoding

If you know the schema of the encoded parameters, then decode them on-chain. For
example, if the schema is `(bytes,string)`:

```solidity
(
    bytes32 header,
    bytes32 name1, bytes memory value1,
    bytes32 name2, string memory value2
) = abi.decode(parameters, (bytes32,bytes32,bytes,bytes32,string));
```

Note that this disregards the header and hard codes the schema into the code. It
is also possible to parse the header on-chain and decode accordingly, yet that
would be a lot more complex.

## Details

### `bytes32`

A parameter being of type `bytes32` implies that the parameter is UTF-8 encoded
text. For example, if the parameter is

```
0x68656c6c6f000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Airnode will decode it as

```
"hello"
```

and feed that to the API, which is what the user would want to do in most cases.

This becomes a problem if the parameter is not encoded text, but for example a
hash such as:

```
0x1fd36c61981313c0c155d33ffac0325bd7c00d21d52442981bb13d2fa13e8f71
```

If this hash is encoded as a `bytes32` type, Airnode will decode it as:

```
√ìla¬ò√Ä√ÅU√ì?√∫√Ä2[√ó√Ä
!√ï$B¬ò¬±=/¬°>¬èq
```

which is probably not what the user is looking for. Instead, the user should
typecast the parameter into a `bytes` type as:

```solidity
bytes parameterAsBytes = abi.encodePacked(parameterAsBytes32);
```

and encode it as such. Then, Airnode would decode it as

```
"0x1fd36c61981313c0c155d33ffac0325bd7c00d21d52442981bb13d2fa13e8f71"
```

### Omitted types

`array` and `tuple` are omitted because they are not suitable to be used as API
parameters. `uint8-uint128`, `int8-int128`, `bytes1-bytes31` are omitted because
they are padded to 32 bytes by the ABI encoder anyway (meaning that the user
should simply typecast these to the 32-byte versions).

Finally, `bool` is omitted to avoid confusion because there are too many types
that start with the letter 'B'. A simple workaround is to encode a `bool` type
parameter as `bytes32` as:

```solidity
bytes32 boolAsBytes32 = boolAsBool ? bytes32("true") : bytes32("false");
```

This works because both `bool(true)` and `bytes32("true")` would be decoded as
`"true"` by the Airnode, and vice versa.

### Size limit

The header can encode up to 31 parameters (and 1 byte is used to encode the
encoding version). This is far more than what would be needed in practice, and
thus is tolerated to avoid a more complex solution.

### Padding

[Strict encoding mode](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.6.12/abi-spec.html#strict-encoding-mode)
is used so that you can decode the values later on. This means that each
parameter will be padded with zeros to complete them to 32 bytes. Although this
padding increases gas costs, ABI encoding/decoding functions being cheap
balances this. Furthermore, the [template](../../concepts/template.md) pattern
used in the protocols allows for the referencing of these encoded parameters
without explicitly passing them in requests, making the increased cost induced
by padding irrelevant in most cases.

## `@api3/airnode-abi`

Encode and decode parameters with the [airnode-abi](../packages/airnode-abi.md)
package.

```js
import { encode } from '@api3/airnode-abi';
import { decode } from '@api3/airnode-abi';

const parameters = [
  { type: 'bytes32', name: 'from', value: 'ETH' },
  { type: 'uint256', name: 'amount', value: '100000' },
];
const encodedData = encode(parameters);
const decoded = decode(encodedData);

console.log('ENCODED:', encodedData);
console.log('\nDECODED:', decoded);
```

See the package doc [airnode-abi](../packages/airnode-abi.md) for more
information on how to encode and decode with Airnode ABI off-chain. Also see
code samples in the
[examples](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/tree/v0.2/packages/airnode-examples)
package.
