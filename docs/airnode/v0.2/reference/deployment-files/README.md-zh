<VersionWarning/> Airnode is deployed with two files:

- [config.json](./config-json.md) is the file that specifies the API–Airnode integrations and various node and deployment parameters.

- [secrets.env](./secrets-env.md) is the file that keeps the secret parameters (airnode mnemonic, API keys, blockchain provider URLs and others) that the Airnode deployments will use.

- [aws.env](./aws-env.md) is the file that holds credentials if the Airnode is deployed to a cloud provider like AWS. It is required by the Docker [deployer image](../../grp-providers/docker/deployer-image.md).

Airnode deployments utilizes secrets such as security scheme values (i.e., API keys) and blockchain provider URLs. While populating `config.json` you can use standard shell variable interpolation syntax (e.g. `${VARIABLE}`) to insert values from `secrets.env`. That way the secrets are kept separately but are available as part of the configuration during the Airnode runtime.

The `config.json` file does reference values in `aws.env` as it is read directly by the deployer image.

The deployer image outputs a [`receipt.json`](receipt-json.md) file after deployment, which contains information about the deployment that can be referred to later on for interaction or removal.
