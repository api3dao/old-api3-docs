As a developer it helps to understand what a **requester** is and what a
**sponsor** does. They are both important parts of the Airnode ecosystem. This
doc will further define them and walk you through the process to derive a
sponsor wallet and to sponsor a requester using the admin CLI commands.

## What is a Requester?

The term [requester](../concepts/requester.md) is important to remember. When
requester is mentioned, the reference is to your smart contract that calls an
Airnode.

As an example see the `myContract.sol` contract in the diagram within the
[Overview](./) doc, it is a requester.

## What is a Sponsor?

Equally important is the term [sponsor](../concepts/sponsor.md). A sponsor is an
entity such as yourself, an organization, etc. Sponsors create relationships
between requesters and Airnodes.

### Sponsor's Requester/Airnode Relationships

As a sponsor you will use the address of an Ethereum account _(called a
[`sponsorAddress`](../concepts/sponsor.md#sponsoraddress))_ from a digital
wallet you own to "sponsor a requester" and then with the same `sponsorAddress`
"derive a [`sponsorWallet`](../concepts/sponsor.md#sponsorwallet)" for an
Airnode. This action creates a relationship between a sponsor's requester and a
particular Airnode. You do this because a sponsor is the entity that pays for
the fulfillment of a request, the gas costs the Airnode will incur. These costs
will be withdrawn from the `sponsorWallet` of the Airnode when the requester
calls it.

In the diagram below a sponsor uses a mnemonic to sponsor a requester with the
Admin CLI. The CLI will use the default address of the mnemonic as the
`sponsorAddress` for the sponsorship. Next the sponsor will derive a
`sponsorWallet` for an Airnode using the same `sponsorAddress`.

Because the requester was sponsored with the same `sponsorAddress` that was used
to derive the `sponsorWallet` of the Airnode, the requester can now make
requests of the Airnode.

In the above diagram it is possible to use the same sponsorAddress
`(0xF4...dDyu9)` to derive other sponsor wallets for other Airnodes. And it is
possible to sponsor more than one requester with this same sponsorAddress.
However it is important to remember that all requesters can now access all the
Airnodes regardless if they need to. There is no harm in this scenario.

### Advanced Scenarios

- Two requesters sponsored with the same sponsorAddress `(0xF4...dDyu9)` could
  access the same Airnode having a sponsor wallet derived by sponsorAddress
  `(0xF4...dDyu9)`.

- Using two separate sponsorAddresses (from two different Ethereum accounts),
  you can derive two separate sponsor wallets for the same Airnode, say
  `(0xF4...dDyu9)` and `(0xG9...fFzc5)`. Then you can sponsor one requester each
  with `(0xF4...dDyu9)` and the other with `(0xG9...fFzc5)`. Now each requester
  will deplete funds from a separate sponsor wallet.

- You have derived two sponsor wallets for two different Airnodes using
  different sponsorAddresses, say `(0xF4...dDyu9)` and `(0xG9...fFzc5)`. You
  have one requester that needs to makes requests from each Airnode. Simply
  sponsor the requester twice with both sponsorAddresses.

### Things to Remember

When you sponsor a requester with a sponsorAddress, you are giving it permission
to use the sponsor wallet associated with the Airnode (created with the same
sponsorAddress).

When the requester makes a request to the Airnode, the Airnode will use funds
from the corresponding sponsor wallet to pay gas costs in response to the
request. Therefore the sponsor pays for the fulfillment of the request.

## Admin CLI Commands

There are several sponsor and requester related commands in the
[Admin CLI Commands](../reference/packages/admin-cli-commands.md) package. You
can also see a list of available commands using
`npx @api3/airnode-admin --help`.

In the next two sections of this doc you will use two commands from the
@api3/airnode-admin package to _sponsor a requester_ and to _derive a sponsor
wallet_.

1. [`sponsor-requester`](../reference/packages/admin-cli-commands.md#sponsor-requester)
   sponsors a requester.
2. [`derive-sponsor-wallet-address`](../reference/packages/admin-cli-commands.md#derive-sponsor-wallet-address)creates
   a sponsor wallet associated with an Airnode.

## How to Sponsor a Requester

When a sponsor uses the same `sponsorAddress` to "sponsor a requester" and to
"derive a sponsor wallet" for an Airnode, the requester will have permission to
make requests to the Airnode on behave of the sponsor. This allows the sponsor
to cover the gas costs incurred by the Airnode when responding to the request.
Sponsors need to keep their sponsor wallets topped off if they want Airnodes to
fulfill requests made by their requesters. However this does not cover the cost
of API data that the Airnode serves, see
[API Provider Fees](fees.md#api-provider-fees).

To sponsor a requester execute the `sponsor-requester` command using the
parameters detailed in the list below. Your requester should already be deployed
on-chain. This command has transaction gas costs.

- `providerURL` A blockchain provider URL (such as Infura) with providerID for
  the desired network.
- `mnemonic` Used for gas costs to fund the sponsorship and used to derive the
  `sponsorAddress` from the default address. The `sponsorAddress` will be needed
  to derive a `sponsorWallet` for an Airnode.
- `requesterAddress` The address of the requester contract.

The command `sponsor-requester` will return the requesterAddress and
sponsorAddress.

## How to Derive a Sponsor Wallet

To use a particular Airnode you must _derive a sponsor wallet_. Once the sponsor
wallet is created it must be funded using the public address returned by the
command`derive-sponsor-wallet-address`. Each Airnode keeps a separate list of
individual sponsor wallets that can access the Airnode. Learn more about
[sponsor wallets](../concepts/sponsor.md#sponsorwallet).

To derive a sponsor wallet for an Airnode execute the
`derive-sponsor-wallet-address` command using the parameters detailed in the
list below. There are no transaction gas costs to do so.

- `providerURL` a blockchain provider URL (such as Infura) with providerID for a
  desired network
- `airnode` of address the desired Airnode
- `sponsor` the sponsorAddress (an address of an Ethereum account) owned by a
  sponsor

The command `derive-sponsor-wallet-address` will return the public address of
the sponsor wallet to be funded by the sponsor.

::: tab Linux/Mac

```bash
npx @api3/airnode-admin derive-sponsor-wallet-address \
  --providerUrl https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/<KEY> \
  --airnode 0xe1...dF05s \
  --sponsor 0xF4...dDyu9

Sponsor wallet address: 0x14D5a34E5a370b9951Fef4f8fbab2b1016D557d9
```

npx @api3/airnode-admin derive-sponsor-wallet-address ^
  --providerUrl https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/<KEY> ^
  --airnode 0xe1...dF05s ^
  --sponsor 0xF4...dDyu9

Sponsor wallet address: 0x14D5a34E5a370b9951Fef4f8fbab2b1016D557d9
```

If you forget the public address of the sponsor wallet simply run
`derive-sponsor-wallet-address` again. Since the wallet already exists for the
airnodeAddress/sponsorAddress pair it will just return the address.

## Record Keeping

During and after deriving a sponsor wallets and sponsoring requesters there are
a few things to keep track of.

| Item            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| requesters      | Record which `sponsorAddress` (from the supplied mnemonic) was used to sponsor a requester.                                                                                                                                                 |
| sponsor wallets | Record which `sponsorAddress` was used to create a sponsorWallet for an Airnode.                                                                                                                                                            |
| sponsor wallets | Record the `sponsorWalletAddress` of the sponsorWallet derived for an Airnode. For each Airnode you have derived a sponsorWallet, the Airnode keeps the private key and returns the public address which is used to fund the sponsorWallet. |

You can acquire the public address of a sponsorWallet later, if you lose it, by
running the command `derive-sponsor-wallet-address` again. Since the
sponsorWallet was already created for the sponsorAddress/airnodeAddress pair,
the command will only return the public address for the wallet. However you must
use the same sponsorAddress used when the wallet was first created or a new
sponsorWallet will be created.
