An **API Provider** is you, if you wish to publish data from your API to
on-chain contracts which are called requesters. You can do so by building an
Airnode. An Airnode is a first-party oracle that will push off-chain API data to
any on-chain requester. See the [Developer](../grp-developers/) section to learn
more about how developers will use your Airnode.

See the [Guides](guides/build-an-airnode/api-integration.md) section in the API
Provider docs to build the necessary files required to deploy an Airnode. The
diagram below illustrates the basic steps to successfully deploy an Airnode.

In summary you only need to do a few things.

- Create cloud provider credentials (AWS), add them to
  [aws.env](../reference/templates/aws-env.md).
- Get a blockchain provider URL for the chain you wish to use (mainnet and/or a
  test network).
- Create the [config.json](../reference/templates/config-json.md) (with an OIS
  object) that defines an Airnode and place any secret values in and
  [secrets.env](../reference/templates/secrets-env.md).
- Run the Docker [deployer-image](./docker/deployer-image.md) to deploy the
  Airnode.
