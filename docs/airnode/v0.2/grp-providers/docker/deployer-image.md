Use the deployer image to deploy or remove an Airnode with a cloud provider such
as AWS. The simplest way is to use the pre-built packages. If you would rather
build the images yourself see the
[README](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/tree/v0.2/packages/airnode-deployer/docker)
in the deployer package.

The deployer image has two commands.

- `deploy`: Deploys or updates an Airnode using configuration files.
- `remove`: Removes an Airnode using its `receipt.json` file.

::: tip Quick Deploy Demo

See the [Quick Deploy](../tutorial/) demo to quickly `deploy` and `remove` a
preconfigured Airnode using the deployer image.

## Cloud Provider Credentials

In order to deploy Airnode to a serverless cloud provider like AWS, you need to
provide could provider credentials to the Airnode deployer image. The deployer
image currently supports deploying to AWS. If you are new to AWS watch this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KngM5bfpttA) to set up an AWS account
and create cloud provider credentials.

## `deploy`

The `deploy` command will create the Airnode with a cloud provider or update it
if it already exists. Three files are needed to run the deploy command.

- config.json
- secrets.env
- aws.env

A `receipt.json` file will be created upon completion. It contains some
deployment information and is used to remove the Airnode.

## `remove`

When an Airnode was deployed using the `deploy` command a `receipt.json` file
was created. Use this file to remove an Airnode.
