Using Docker is the easiest way to both deploy an Airnode to a cloud provider
and to run an Airnode locally. There are two Docker images: the Airnode deployer
image and the Airnode client image. To use these images first install
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if it is not present on your
system.

- The [deployer image](./deployer-image.md) deploys the node in the form of
  serverless functions to a serverless cloud provider (e.g. AWS Lambda).

- The [client image](client-image.md) is the node itself, containerized. The
  container can be run locally or deployed to a cloud hosting service (e.g. AWS
  EC2 or Lightsail).

- The admin image is only available for Airnode versions 3 and higher.
