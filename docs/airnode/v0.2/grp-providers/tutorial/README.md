This demo is a simple Airnode deployment, using a hands-on approach, to better
understand the overall deployment process of the
[deployer image](../../grp-providers/docker/deployer-image.md). It uses an API
endpoint (`GET /coins/{id}`) from
[CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) which returns the
current value of a coin. This demo does not detail the overall configuration of
an Airnode, it is just a quick start.

::: tip Additional Examples

There are additional examples of Airnode deployments in the
[examples package](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/tree/v0.2/packages/airnode-examples)
of the Airnode repo.

- Run Airnode as a docker container locally while connected to Rinkeby network.
- Run Airnode as a docker container locally, but connected to the hardhat
  (local) network.
- Deploy Airnode on AWS and use the Rinkeby network.

:::

An Airnode deployment uses a Docker image (called
[deployer image](../../grp-providers/docker/deployer-image.md)) which in turn
requires three files as input.

- [config.json](./config-json.md)
- [secrets.env](./secrets-env.md)
- [aws.env](./aws-env.md)

For the purpose of this demo these files have been created and only require a
few minor changes on your part to make the deployment of the demo Airnode
successful. These change are needed to supply AWS credentials, a chain provider
url, a mnemonic and an apiKey.

## Install Prerequisites

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if it is not present on
your system and launch it.

## Project Folder

Create a folder called `/quick-deploy-demo` with two more internal folders named
`/config` and `/output`. Place the contents of the files provided
([config.json](./config-json.md), [secrets.env](./secrets-env.md) and
[aws.env](./aws-env.md)) into the locations show below.

```
quick-deploy-demo
├── aws.env
├── config
│   ├── config.json
│   └── secrets.env
└── output
    ├── receipt.json
```

By default, the deployer image looks for `config.json` and `secrets.env` in
`/config`, `aws.env` in `/quick-deploy-demo` and writes `receipt.json` to the
`/output` folder.

## Configuration

Prepare the three configuration files.

### config.json

This file requires no changes on your part. It has been created with just one
API endpoint and will use the Rinkeby test network. There are three variables
this file will extract (interpolation) from `secrets.env`.

### secrets.env

Add values for each of the these fields.

- `CHAIN_PROVIDER_URL`: A chain provider url from a provider such as
  [Infura](https://infura.io/). Make sure the provider url you use is for the
  Rinkeby test network. Using another chain provider other than Infura is
  acceptable.

  - Sign-up or login to Infura.
  - Create a new project, select the **Settings** tab in the project.
  - Copy the URL (https) for Rinkeby under the Endpoints pick list.

- `AIRNODE_WALLET_MNEMONIC`: Provide the seed phrase (mnemonic) to a digital
  wallet. For the purpose of this demo it does not need eth in it for the
  Rinkeby test network.

- `HTTP_GATEWAY_API_KEY`: Make up an apiKey to authenticate calls to the HTTP
  Gateway. Used to test your Airnode with CURL later. The expected length is
  30 - 128 characters.

### aws.env

Add the access credentials to your AWS account. The deployer image will use them
to install the Airnode functions to Lambda under your account's control. If you
do not have an account watch this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KngM5bfpttA) to create one. Unlike
`secrets.env`, you cannot surround values with double quotes (").

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Is ACCESS_KEY_ID in IAM.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Is SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in IAM.

## Deploy

Make sure Docker is running and then execute the deployer image from the root of
the `quick-deploy-demo` folder. A `receipt.json` file will be created upon
completion. It contains some deployment information and is used to remove the
Airnode.

Run the following command to deploy the demo Airnode. Note that the version of
`api3/airnode-deployer` matches the `nodeVersion` in the config.json file.

## Test the Airnode

After a successful deployment the Airnode can be tested directly using the
[HTTP Gateway](../guides/build-an-airnode/http-gateway.md) without accessing the
blockchain. You provide endpoint parameters to get a response from an integrated
API.

### HTTP Gateway

Looking at the config.json shows that the HTTP Gateway was activated for our
Airnode. Furthermore the endpoint for `/coins/{id}` is set to be testable, see
`endpoints[0]`. While the Airnode is enabled for the gateway, each individual
endpoint must be marked as `testable` to allow access.

```json
"nodeSettings": {
 ...
  "httpGateway": {
    "enabled": true, // The gateway is activated for this Airnode
    "apiKey": "${HTTP_GATEWAY_API_KEY}" // Gateway apiKey
  },
...
},
"endpoints": [
    {
      "name": "coinMarketData",
      "operation": {
        "method": "get",
        "path": "/coins/{id}"
      },
      "testable":true, // This endpoint can be tested by the gateway
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

### Execute Endpoint

Use CURL to execute the Airnode and get the results from the CoinGecko endpoint
`/coins/{id}` bypassing the Rinkeby test network that Airnode was deployed for.
As an alternative to CURL try an app such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/rest-client/). Windows users can
also use
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
(WSL2) to run CURL for Linux.

In order to test the endpoint make an HTTP POST request with the `endpointId` as
a path parameter, the `x-api-key` in the header and endpoint parameters in the
request body as a key/value pairs.

- `-v`: Verbose output is optional.
- `-H`: The `x-api-key` using the value of `HTTP_GATEWAY_API_KEY` from
  `secrets.env` file.
- `-d`: Use request body data to pass all endpoint parameters.

Breaking down the URL in the CURL command below:

- `<httpGatewayUrl>`: The base URL to the gateway, found in the `receipts.json`
  file. Update the placeholder in the CURL example below with its value.
- `0x6db9e3e3d073ad12b66d28dd85bcf49f58577270b1cc2d48a43c7025f5c27af6`: Passed
  as a path parameter, the endpointId to call, see `triggers.rrp[0].endpointId`
  in the `config.json` file.

## Remove the Airnode

When you are done with this demo you can remove it. When the Airnode was
deployed a `receipt.json` file was created in the `/output` folder. This file is
needed to remove an Airnode.

- `--env-file`: Location of the `aws.env` file.
- `-v`: Location of the `receipt.json` file.
