::: tip Tips

Be sure to complete [API Integration](api-integration.md) before configuring
your Airnode.

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md)
This icon links to additional field information in the reference section.

:::

An Airnode is deployed or redeployed using configuration values from its
`config.json` and `secrets.env` files. The `config.json` specifies the
[OIS](../../../reference/specifications/ois.md) (Oracle Integration
Specifications) and other specific configuration details. The `secrets.env` file
holds secrets, such as API keys and chain provider URLs, which are referenced
within the config.json file using interpolation.

The following example files are useful while reading this doc.

- [config.json](../../../reference/examples/config-json.md)
- [secrets.env](../../../reference/examples/secrets-env.md)
- [aws.env](../../../reference/examples/aws-env.md)

## Creating `config.json`

Use the [config.json template](../../../reference/templates/config-json.md) to
build your own Airnode configuration file or alter the
[config.json example](../../../reference/examples/config-json.md) file. There
are five root level fields in `config.json`.

- [chains](./configuring-airnode.md#chains)
- [nodeSettings](./configuring-airnode.md#nodesettings)
- [triggers](./configuring-airnode.md#triggers)
- [ois](./configuring-airnode.md#ois)
- [apiCredentials](./configuring-airnode.md#apicredentials)

### chains

Each row in the `chains` array represents an Ethereum blockchain the Airnode
will serve as identified by the `id`. Currently Airnode only supports Ethereum
blockchains as denoted by `type: "evm"`. There are several supported
blockchains, see them in the
[Airnode contract addresses](../../../reference/airnode-addresses.md) doc. You
can use multiple chain providers for each chain and declare multiple chains each
with one of more chain providers. See
[Chains Providers](../../../concepts/chain-providers.md) in _Concepts and
Definitions_.

Below is a simple chain array with a single chain provider.

```json
"chains": [
  {
    "authorizers": [
      "0x5Fgh48...3F6f64180acc"
    ],
    "contracts": {
      "AirnodeRrp": "0xF6d267546...BC9A384fa418"
    },
    "id": "4",
    "providers": [
      "infura_rinkeby": {
        "url": "${INFURA_RINKEBY_PROVIDER_URL}"
      }
    ],
    "type": "evm",
    "blockHistoryLimit": 300,
    "ignoreBlockedRequestsAfterBlocks": 20
  }
],
```

<!-- "minConfirmations": 0, -->

#### authorizers

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#authorizers)
The list of authorizer contract addresses the Airnode deployment will set
on-chain. See the [Authorization](../../../concepts/authorization.md) doc for
more information.

#### contracts

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#contracts)
Contains the addresses of the contracts that implement the Airnode protocols.
Although you can deploy these contracts yourself, you are recommended to use the
ones that were deployed by API3. You can find them in the list above.

#### id

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#id)
An Airnode can serve multiple chains simultaneously. Set the ID of the desired
chain in `id` (e.g., `4` for Rinkeby test network). See the list of supported
chains in the
[Airnode Contract Addresses](../../../reference/airnode-addresses.md) doc. See
additional definition in the
[reference section](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#id).

#### providers

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#providers)
Airnode can use multiple Ethereum providers per chain. These could be a private
Ethereum node, or an Ethereum service provider such as Infura. Accordingly, the
`providers` field is a list which allows for multiple Ethereum providers. Enter
a user defined `name` which identifies the provider and the provider URL which
usually is kept in the `secrets.env` file. The name is used in logs.

#### type

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#type)
The type of the chain. Only `evm` is supported at this time. See additional
definition in the
[reference section](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#type).

#### blockHistoryLimit

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#blockhistorylimit)
The number of blocks in the past that the Airnode deployment should search for
requests. Defaults to `300` (roughly 1 hour for Ethereum).

<!--#### minConfirmations

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#minconfirmations)
The number of confirmations required for a request to be considered valid.
Defaults to `0`. -->

#### ignoreBlockedRequestsAfterBlocks

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#ignoreblockedrequestsafterblocks)
The number of blocks that need to pass for the node to start ignoring blocked
requests. Defaults to `20`.

### nodeSettings

The `nodeSettings` field holds node-specific (Airnode) configuration parameters.

```json
{
"nodeSettings": {
    "cloudProvider": "aws",
    "airnodeWalletMnemonic": "${AIRNODE_WALLET_MNEMONIC}",
    "heartbeat": {
      "enabled": true,
      "apiKey": "${HEARTBEAT_API_KEY}",
      "id": "${HEARTBEAT_ID}",
      "url": "${HEARTBEAT_URL}"
    },
    "httpGateway": {
      "enabled": true,
      "apiKey": "${HTTP_GATEWAY_API_KEY}"
    },
    "logFormat": "plain",
    "logLevel": "INFO",
    "nodeVersion": "0.2.2",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "stage": "dev"
  },
```

#### cloudProvider

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#cloudprovider)
Indicates which cloud provider Airnode should be deployed with or if it should
be run locally. The deployer currently supports `aws` or `local`.

- `aws`: Airnode is deployed using the docker
  [deployer-image](../../docker/deployer-image.md).
- `local`: Airnode is deployed using the docker
  [client-image](../../docker/client-image.md).

#### airnodeWalletMnemonic

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#airnodewalletmnemonic)
An API provider provides a mnemonic to be used as the Airnode's BIP 44 wallet
from which the Airnode's [address](../../../concepts/airnode.md#airnodeaddress)
will be derived. It is not required to fund the wallet to run the Airnode but
must be funded to announce the [xpub](../../../concepts/airnode.md#xpub) of the
Airnode on-chain which is optional.

#### heartbeat

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#heartbeat)
At the end of each of Airnode's runs (every minute), Airnode can make an HTTP
POST request to a specified URL. This is both to signal that the Airnode is
alive and working (useful especially right after the deployment) and also to
send some metrics from its run. Turn on the heartbeat functionality by setting
all fields in the config.json section nodeSettings.heartbeat. See the
[Heartbeat](./heartbeat.md) doc for more info.

- enabled: Enable/disable Airnode's heartbeat.
- url: The URL to make the heartbeat request to.
- apiKey: The API key to authenticate against the heartbeat URL.
- id: The Airnode heartbeat ID for accounting purposes.

#### httpGateway

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#httpgateway)
The gateway allows the testing of defined endpoints without accessing the
blockchain. See the [HTTP Gateway](./http-gateway.md) doc for more info.

- enabled: Enable/disable Airnode's Access to the HTTP gateway
- apiKey: A user defined API key to authenticate against the gateway. The key
  must have a length of between 30 - 120 characters.

#### logFormat

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#logformat)
Set one of two possible log formats.

- json
- plain

#### logLevel

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#loglevel)
Set one of four possible log levels.

- DEBUG
- INFO
- WARN
- ERROR

#### nodeVersion

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#nodeversion)
Of the form `#.#.#`, this field indicates which node (Airnode) version this
`config.json` is prepared for. Since the `config.json` format can be expected to
change with node versions, using a `config.json` prepared for one Airnode
version with another may result in unexpected issues. See the
[Releases page of the Airnode repo](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/releases)
for available versions.

#### region

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#region)
This field can be seen as an extension of `cloudProvider`, it refers to which
region of the cloud provider Airnode will be deployed at. An example value for
AWS would be `us-east-1`. Note that transferring a deployment from one region to
the other is not trivial at this moment (i.e., it does not take one command like
deployment, but rather three). Therefore, try to pick a region and stick to it
for this specific deployment.

#### stage

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#stage)
This field allows the deployment of multiple Airnodes with the same provider ID.
For example, the provider may deploy one Airnode with the stage `api3` to serve
API3 dAPIs, and one with the stage `public` that serves the public. A regular
user will have a single deployment, so feel free to set any descriptive name as
your `stage`.

### triggers

The `triggers` field allows you to expose Airnode endpoints from an OIS
selectively. For example, your OIS may include ten endpoints, but you may only
want to serve two. Instead of modifying the OIS, you would simply create
triggers for the two. List the endpoints that you want to serve with the
request–response protocol under `triggers.rrp`. In most cases, you would create
a trigger for each endpoint in your OIS object.

#### oisTitle & endpointName

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#rrp-oistitle)
Each trigger has an `oisTitle` and `endpointName` that allow you to refer to one
of the endpoints in an OIS object. Remember that an Airnode's config.json file
can have more than one OIS object. Fill these in accordingly.

#### endpointId

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#rrp-endpointid)
Add an `endpointId` to the trigger which is the ID that a requester will use for
on-chain requests to reference a specific trigger. Use the admin CLI command
[derive-endpoint-id](../../../reference/packages/admin-cli-commands.md#derive-endpoint-id)
to derive endpoint IDs using the `oisTitle` and `endpointName`.

```bash
npx @api3/airnode-admin derive-endpoint-id \
  --oisTitle "My OIS title..." \
  --endpointName "My endpoint name..."
```

### ois

The `ois` field is a list OIS objects that Airnode will be serving. This means
that a single instance of an Airnode can serve multiple APIs. You can simply
copy paste OIS objects that you will be serving into the `ois` list. Use the
previous guide [API Integration](api-integration.md) to create an OIS object.

### apiCredentials

Each entry in `apiCredentials` maps to a security scheme defined in an OIS
(`ois[n].components.securitySchemes.{securitySchemeName}` and
`ois[n].security`), where `oisTitle` is the `title` field of the related OIS,
and `securitySchemeName` is the name of the respective security scheme. These
would be `myOisTitle` and `mySecurityScheme` in the example below.
`securitySchemeValue` is the value used for the authentication with the security
scheme (e.g., the API key).

Use of apiCredentials is not required, leave its array empty if you don't need
any security scheme.

```json
// apiCredentials
[
  {
    "oisTitle": "myOisTitle",
    "securitySchemeName": "mySecurityScheme",
    "securitySchemeValue": "${SS_MY_API_KEY}"
  }
]

// From the OIS object apiCredentials is referencing
// using the oisTitle/securitySchemeName pair.
{
  "title": "myOisTitle",
  ...,
  "components": {
    "securitySchemes": {
      "mySecurityScheme": {
        "in": "header",
        "type": "apiKey",
        "name": "X-api-key"
      }
    }
  },
  "security":{
    "mySecurityScheme": []
  }
  ...
}
```

#### `oisTitle`

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#oistitle)
The `ois.title` of the OIS where the `securitySchemeName` can be found.

#### `securitySchemeName`

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#securityschemename)
The name of a security scheme from
`ois[n].components.securitySchemes.{securitySchemeName}`.

#### `securitySchemeValue`

[<img :src="$withBase('/img/info-green-20.png')" alt="info" class="infoIcon">](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#securityschemevalue)
The value of the security scheme used (as defined by
`ois[n].components.securitySchemes.{securitySchemeName}` for the authentication.
Usually stored in `secrets.env`.

Based on the setup above Airnode will call the API operation with the following
header.

```json
headers: {
  "X-api-key": "834989348HHGTDS_8754",
}
```

## Creating `secrets.env`

The `secrets.env` file contains values (secrets) such as blockchain provider
urls, chain provider urls, etc. These secrets are embedded in
[config.json](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md) using
interpolation.

```json
// Sample interpolation value from config.json
"httpGateway": {
  "enabled": true,
  "apiKey": "${HTTP_GATEWAY_API_KEY}"
},

// Sample variable in secrets.env
HTTP_GATEWAY_API_KEY="FRACZKMH4F32BZ8X5uTd"
```

Use the [secrets.env](../../../reference/templates/secrets-env.md) template and
refer to
[Reference > Deployment Files > secrets.env](../../../reference/deployment-files/secrets-env.md)
as needed.

## Creating `aws.env`

When it is time to deploy the Airnode to a cloud provider (AWS), the Docker
[deployer image](../../docker/deployer-image.md) will need the AWS credentials
to build the node on AWS Lambda.

Follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KngM5bfpttA) if needed. It
will show you how to create an IAM user and get security credentials. Put them
in the `aws.env` file as shown below. Note that double quotes (") are not
permitted to enclose the values as with the `secrets.env` file.

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XYZ...123
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=ABC7...89
```

Here is an [example file](../../../reference/templates/aws-env.md) that is left
blank.

## Summary

In this guide you created the `config.json`, `secrets.env` and `aws.env` files
required to deploy an Airnode to a cloud provider (AWS). Note that `config.json`
is user-specific and therefore it is not much use to others.

The `secrets.env`and `aws.env` files contains keys, chain provider urls and
security credentials, so they should be kept secret. Make sure that you do not
push your credentials (`secrets.env` and `aws.env`) to a repository or otherwise
expose them as these credentials can be used to gain access to your Airnode's
private key and AWS account.

The next three steps in this guide are optional.

- [Applying Authorization](./apply-auth.md) optional
- [Heartbeat](./heartbeat.md) optional
- [HTTP Gateway](./http-gateway.md) optional
