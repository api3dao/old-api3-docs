Airnode can pass along security information (schemes) when making calls to API
operations. There are two groups of security schemes.

- [Airnode Authentication](../../../concepts/airnode-auth.md)
- [Relayed Meta Data Authentication](../../../concepts/relay-meta-auth.md)

Security schemes are declared by the required `type` property inside the
security scheme definition. The following security scheme types are supported.

- Airnode Authentication Security Schemes

  - apiKey
  - http

- Relayed Meta Data Security Schemes
  - relayRequesterAddress
  - relayChainId
  - relayChainType
  - relaySponsorAddress
  - relaySponsorWalletAddress
  - relayRequestId

## Airnode Authentication Security Schemes

An Airnode can use the following security scheme types to authenticate itself to
API operations.

- [apiKey](./api-security.md#apikey)
- [http](./api-security.md#http)

### apiKey

The `apiKey` security scheme type allows you to define an API key the Airnode
will send to your API operations. It is an object which consists of the
following fields:

- `type` must be `apiKey`
- `in` can be one of the `query`, `header` or `cookie`. This value specifies how
  should the value be sent to your API. When using the `query` option, the API
  key will be sent in the request body for POST requests and in query string for
  GET requests.

- `name` is the name of the API key that should be sent to your API. For example
  "X-Api-Key".

```json
{
  "requiresXApiKey": {
    "in": "header",
    "type": "apiKey",
    "name": "X-api-key"
  }
}
```

The value of the `apiKey` goes in the `apiCredentials` field of `config.json`.
Normally the value is accessed using interpolation from the `secrets.env` file.

```json
{
  "oisTitle": "Ois Title",
  "securitySchemeName": "requiresXApiKey",
  "securitySchemeValue": "${X_API_KEY}" // interpolated from secrets.env
}
```

### http

The `http` security scheme type allows you to define a `basic` or `bearer`
authentication. This security scheme will always be sent in the headers. The
security scheme value should be base64 encoded value "username:password" for
`basic` auth and the encoded token for `bearer` auth. It is an object which
consists of the following fields:

- `type` must be `http`
- `scheme` is either `basic` or `bearer`

```json
{
  "requiresBasicAuth": {
    "scheme": "basic",
    "type": "http"
  }
}
```

The value of the `http` as (`basic or bearer`) goes in the `apiCredentials`
field of `config.json`. Normally the value is accessed using interpolation from
the `secrets.emv` file.

```json
{
  "oisTitle": "Ois Title",
  "securitySchemeName": "requiresBasicAuth",
  "securitySchemeValue": "${BASE_64_ENCODED_BASIC_AUTH}" // interpolated from secrets.env
}
```

::: tip Authentication Tutorial

The `authenticated-coinmarketcap` monorepo example demonstrates authentication,
[see here](../../tutorial/README.md#monorepo-examples).

:::

## Relayed Meta Data Security Schemes

In addition to authenticating itself, Airnode can "relay" security information
about a request to an API operation. This is different then
[Authorization](./apply-auth.md) of requesters to access the Airnode.

- [relayRequesterAddress](./api-security.md#relayrequesteraddress)
- [relayChainId](./api-security.md#relaychainid)
- [relayChainType](./api-security.md#relaychaintype)
- [relaySponsorAddress](./api-security.md#relaysponsoraddress)
- [relaySponsorWalletAddress](./api-security.md#relaysponsorwalletaddress)
- [relayRequestId](./api-security.md#relayrequestid)

For relayed meta data security schemes you do not provide any values in
[apiCredentials](../../../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#apicredentials)
as they are extracted from the request by Airnode.

::: tip Additional Processing Logic

Note that Airnode is just relaying metadata to your API operations and does not
perform any additional logic. You must implement any desired logic in your API
operations. See
[Relayed Meta Data Authentication](../../../concepts/relay-meta-auth.md) for
overview of its usage.

::: tip Relay Metadata Tutorial

The `relay-security-schemes` monorepo example demonstrates how to relay multiple
request metadata like chain ID and sponsor address to the API endpoint,
[see here](../../tutorial/README.md#monorepo-examples).

:::

### relayRequesterAddress

The `relayRequesterAddress` security scheme type instructs Airnode to forward
the [requester](../../../concepts/requester.md) address.

```json
{
  "in": "header",
  "type": "relayRequesterAddress",
  "name": "requesterAddress"
}
```

### relayChainId

The `relayChainId` security scheme type instructs Airnode to forward the chain's
ID.

```json
{
  "in": "query",
  "type": "relayChainId",
  "name": "chainId"
}
```

### relayChainType

The `relayChainType` security scheme type instructs Airnode to forward the
chain's type.

```json
{
  "in": "query",
  "type": "relayChainType",
  "name": "chainType"
}
```

### relaySponsorAddress

The `relaySponsorAddress` security scheme type instructs Airnode to forward the
[sponsor address](../../../concepts/sponsor.md#sponsoraddress).

```json
{
  "in": "query",
  "type": "relaySponsorAddress",
  "name": "sponsorAddress"
}
```

### relaySponsorWalletAddress

The `relaySponsorWalletAddress` security scheme type instructs Airnode to
forward the
[sponsor wallet address](../../../concepts/sponsor.md#sponsorwallet).

```json
{
  "in": "query",
  "type": "relaySponsorWalletAddress",
  "name": "sponsorWalletAddress"
}
```

### relayRequestId

The `relayRequestId` security scheme type instructs Airnode to forward the
[id of the request](../../../concepts/request.md#requestid).

```json
{
  "in": "query",
  "type": "relayRequestId",
  "name": "requestId"
}
```

## Example

OIS security is inspired by OAS security practices. This is implemented using
the security schemes and security field. All supported security schemes are
described in detail in the
[Airnode Authentication Security Schemes](./api-security.md#airnode-authentication-security-schemes)
and
[Relayed Meta Data Security Schemes](./api-security.md#relayed-meta-data-security-schemes)
sections above. The following example is related to _Airnode Authentication
Security Schemes_. Working with security schemes can be described in three
steps.

1. [Define the security schemes for an OIS](./api-security.md#step-1-define-the-security-schemes-for-an-ois)
2. [Turn on the defined security schemes](./api-security.md#step-2-turn-on-the-defined-security-schemes)
3. [Specify the values for the defined security schemes](./api-security.md#step-3-specify-the-values-for-the-defined-security-schemes)

Following is an example of a partial `config.json` which demonstrates the usage
of security scheme and security field.

```json
{
  "ois": [
    {
      "title": "My OIS title",
      "apiSpecifications": {
        "components": {
          "securitySchemes": {
            "requiresXApiKey": {
              "in": "header",
              "type": "apiKey",
              "name": "X-api-key"
            }
          }
        },
        "security": {
          "requiresXApiKey": []
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "apiCredentials": [
    {
      "oisTitle": "My OIS title",
      "securitySchemeName": "requiresXApiKey",
      "securitySchemeValue": "${X_API_KEY}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step #1: Define the security schemes for an OIS

You use
<code style="overflow-wrap:break-word;">ois[n].apiSpecifications.components.securitySchemes</code>
to define the security schemes your API will use. Consider the partial
`config.json` above that declares a security scheme named "requiresXApiKey".
This scheme declares that the API requires an API key that must exist in the
HTTP header named "X-api-key".

### Step #2: Turn on the defined security schemes

When the scheme is defined, it is not turned on by default. You need to
explicitly list the security schemes you intend to use in the `security` field
located in `ois[n].apiSpecifications.security` object. The keys in this object
are the names of security schemes to be used. Use empty array (`[]`) as values
for now.

_Be aware that this step seems like extra work since there is no reason to
define a security scheme that will not be used. However, Airnode may support
[more complex authentication](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#security-requirement-object)
logic in the future and using `[]` allows its implementation without a breaking
change._

### Step #3: Specify the values for the defined security schemes

After defining and turning on a security scheme, it may be unclear what provides
the value and how it is set.

The authentication schemes are intended to be common for the whole OIS and set
by the API provider using `apiCredentials` part of the `config.json`. The
`apiCredentials` is an array which specifies the values for all security schemes
in all OIS definitions. Each element of this array contains the following fields

- `oisTitle` is the title of the OIS for the particular security scheme
- `securitySchemeName` is the name of the security scheme
- `securitySchemeValue` is the actual value that should be used by Airnode when
  making the API request. This value is usually a secret and it is recommended
  to interpolate it from `secrets.env`.

If you want to base your API authentication on dynamic data, for example
[requester](../../../concepts/requester.md) address, you can utilize the relayed
meta data security schemes
[described above](./api-security.md#relayrequesteraddress) which can forward
metadata to all API operations.

::: tip Relayed meta data security schemes values.

The relayed meta data security schemes do not require a supplied value. Values
will be provided (relayed) by Airnode depending on the particular request.

:::

## Using Different Security Schemes

Currently, if you want different API operations to use different security
schemes they must be grouped in different OIS objects based on their common
security schemes. For example, your API has four operations, three require an
API key in the HTTP header, another (public `/ping` endpoint) requires no
security.

- The first three API operations might be in the `ois[0]` object with a security
  scheme named _requiresXApiKey_ of type _apiKey_ as shown above.
- The /ping API operation would be in `ois[1]` which would not have any
  `component.securitySchemes` and `security` would be an empty array.

## Multiple Security Schemes

You can use multiple security schemes (e.g., an API key goes in the header, and
an additional secret goes in the query).

```json
// inside ois[n].apiSpecifications.
"components": {
  "securitySchemes": {
    "requiresXApiKey": {
      "type": "apiKey",
      "in": "header",
      "name": "X-api-key"
    },
    "specificQuerySecret": {
      "type": "apiKey",
      "in": "query",
      "name": "secret"
    }
  }
},
"security": {
  "requiresXApiKey": [],
  "specificQuerySecret": []
}
```

## No Security

If the API you are integrating is publicly accessible, you can set both the
`security schemes` and `security` fields to empty objects.
