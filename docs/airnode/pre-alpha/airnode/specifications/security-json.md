`security.json` is the file the deployer uses to push API credentials along with the serverless function.

Has two fields:
- `apiCredentials`: Keeps the values of the security scheme parameters and the necessary fields to identify them
- `id`: A UUID for the specific `config.json` file and its corresponding `security.json` file

## `apiCredentials`

An example:

```json
{
  "myOisTitle": [
    {
      "securitySchemeName": "mySecurityScheme",
      "value": "mysupersecretkey"
    }
  ]
}
```

## The user flow

Here is an example `security.json` file that is generated by a third party (e.g., an integration platform):

```json
{
  "apiCredentials": {
    "myOisTitle": [
      {
        "securitySchemeName": "mySecurityScheme",
        "value": "<TO_BE_FILLED>"
      }
    ]
  },
  "id": "9a52131e-babd-11ea-b3de-0242ac130004"
}
```
