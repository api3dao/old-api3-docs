When a client makes a request using `Airnode.sol`, it is returned a `requestId`.
This `requestId` is a hash of all request parameters and a nonce.
This allows Airnode to verify that the request parameters are not tampered with.

## Request parameters

- `providerId` and `endpointId` specify the endpoint
- `requesterIndex` and `designatedWallet` specify which wallet will be used to fulfill the request
- `fulfillAddress` and `fulfillFunctionId` specify which method will be called to fulfill the request
- `parameters` specify the API and [reserved](../../airnode/specifications/ois.md#_5-4-reservedparameters
) parameters (see [Airnode ABI specifications](../../airnode/specifications/airnode-abi-specifications.md) for how these are encoded)

## How templates are used in requests

A template includes the following fields:

```solidity
struct Template {
    bytes32 providerId;
    bytes32 endpointId;
    uint256 requesterIndex;
    address designatedWallet;
    address fulfillAddress;
    bytes4 fulfillFunctionId;
    bytes parameters;
    }
```

The client can refer to the `templateId` of a template while making the request, and the provider's Airnode will fetch these and use them in the request.
Among these, `requesterIndex`, `designatedWallet`, `fulfillAddress`, `fulfillFunctionId` can be overridden by parameters defined at request-time.

When a template is used to make a request, both the parameters encoded in `parameters` of the template and `parameters` provided at request-time by the client will be used by the provider's Airnode.
In case the two include a parameter with the same name, the one provided at request-time will be used.

## Request types

There are multiple request types with respect to how they utilize templates:

### 1. Regular request

A regular request refers to a template, yet provides its own `requesterIndex`, `designatedWallet`, `fulfillAddress`, `fulfillFunctionId` that will override the ones from the template.

### 2. Short request

A short request refers to a template for all parameters.

### 3. Full request

A full request does not refer to a template at all.
They are useful if the client will not make a similar request ever again (e.g., in a prediction market context).

## Request outcomes

A request made to an Airnode has three possible outcomes:

### 1. Fulfill

If the node encountered no errors at any step, it calls the `fulfill()` method that will call back the method `fulfillFunctionId` at `fulfillAddress` to deliver `data` and 0 as the `statusCode`.

If the node encountered an error, it will do the same, but `statusCode` will be non-0, indicating to the client that the request has failed (see [this](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/tree/pre-alpha/packages/node#behaviour) for details).
The client can then handle this error as it sees fit (e.g., ignore it, make a request to an alternative provider, etc.)

### 2. Fail

If `fulfill()` reverts, the node calls the `fail()` method to report this.
The node will not attempt to fulfill a failed request afterwards.

### 3. Ignore

If the node cannot even fail a request (e.g., the client is not endorsed by the requester), the request gets ignored.
