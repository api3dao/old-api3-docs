We are assuming that you have [configured your Airnode](configuring-airnode.md) (and set `endpointId`s of your endpoints), and [deployed your Airnode](deploying-airnode.md) and received your `providerId` in your receipt file.
Requesters who know your `providerId` and `endpointId`s should now be able to make requests to your endpoints.
However, you probably do not want to serve the entire public with your Airnode, but rather
- Only serve your own client contracts
- Only serve requesters who have made a subscription payment
- Only serve requesters who have gone through KYC
- ...

In this guide, we will explain how you can achieve this.

## `authorizers`

[EndpointStore.sol](../../protocols/request-response/general-structure.md#endpointstore-sol) keeps a list of [authorizer](../../protocols/request-response/authorizer.md) addresses for each `providerId`â€“`endpointId` pair.
An authorizer is a contract that Airnode calls to check if it should respond to a specific request.
It can enforce any kind of authorization policy that one could implement as a contract.

## Default state: Deny all

By default, the authorizers of all endpoints of a provider is an empty list.
An empty authorizers list means that endpoint is not allowed to be used by anyone.
Therefore, after deploying your Airnode, you must also set authorizers for your endpoints for them to be accessible.

## Allow all

The simplest authorization policy is opening the endpoint to the public, so let us see how to do that first.
Authorizers being set to `[0]` means that all requests made to it will be authorized (i.e., will be responded to by Airnode).
Only the `providerAdmin` of a provider can update the authorizers of its endpoints.
Therefore, you will need to make a transaction using the provider admin address (that you have set in `config.json` as `providerAdminForRecordCreation`) to [EndpointStore.sol](../../protocols/request-response/general-structure.md#endpointstore-sol).
In JS (using ethers.js):
```js
airnode.connect(providerAdmin).updateEndpointAuthorizers(providerId, endpointId, [ethers.constants.AddressZero]);
```
You can also use [@api3/airnode-admin](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/tree/pre-alpha/packages/admin#update-authorizers) to update endpoint authorizers.

After making this transaction, your Airnode will respond to all requests.
Note that being able to do this on-chain through `providerAdmin` allows you to update your authorization policies without interacting with your Airnode or having to redeploy it.

## Custom authorization policies

We have mentioned that authorizer contracts can implement any arbitrary authorization logic.
See [this example](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/blob/pre-alpha/packages/protocol/contracts/authorizers/MinBalanceAuthorizer.sol) where Airnode only responds to requests if the wallet it will use to fulfill the request has a balance more than an amount set by the provider admin.

The authorizer list allows you to combine single-purpose authorizer contracts to form complex policies as described in the [docs](../../protocols/request-response/authorizer.md#authorizer-list).
If you would like to contribute to this set of authorizer contracts, please join the conversation in [this issue](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/issues/38).

## Conclusion

Your Airnode is completely set up now.
The following guides will be on how a requester would be able to make requests to it.
