Airnode serves an API to a blockchain according to
[Oracle Integration Specifications (OIS)](/ois/v1.2/). An API is composed of
[operations](/ois/v1.2/ois.md#_5-2-operation), which represent individual
functionalities that an API offers. OIS maps each API operation to an
[endpoint](/ois/v1.2/ois.md#_5-endpoints), which can be thought of as an Airnode
operation. The endpoints that an Airnode will serve over the request–response
protocol are listed under
[triggers](../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md#triggers) of
[config.json](../reference/deployment-files/config-json.md).

## `endpointId`

`endpointId` identifies specific endpoints that an Airnode serves, and is
computed in JS (using ethers.js) as follows:

```js
ethers.utils.keccak256(
  ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
    ['string', 'string'],
    [oisTitle, endpointName]
  )
);
```

An alternative method to create an `endpointId` is to use the
[Admin CLI](../reference/packages/admin-cli.md) to derive the endpoint ID.

Note that this means that an `endpointId` is not unique, and two Airnodes can
serve equivalent endpoints using the same ID (in fact, this is the desired
outcome).This is not an issue, as requests are made with a `airnode` (Airnode's
`address`) and `endpointId` pair.

This convention of determining an `endpointId` is not enforced at the
protocol-level. For example, one could choose to generate an `endpointId`
randomly, and as long as requesters use the correct `endpointId`, this will not
be an issue.

## Authorizers

Airnodes can assign a list of authorizers to their endpoints. See the section
[Authorizer](authorizers.md) for more information.
