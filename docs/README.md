- title: What is API3?
  details: API3 is a collaborative project to deliver traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. It is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), its code is open source and its operations are transparent.
- title: API3 Thesis Statement
  details: The vast majority of the external integrations that decentralized applications need are to commercial Web APIs that traditional businesses have built to monetize their data and services. Therefore, what is widely known as the oracle problem is in practice the API connectivity problem. Existing oracle solutions fall short because they fail to make this distinction, resulting in inferior solutions that depend on third-party oracles and ecosystems that exclude API providers. By refining the definition of the problem, API3 aims to provide a much more optimal solution.
- title: The Airnode
  details: As you'll learn throughout this documentation, at its core API3 brings the ability for API providers to easily run their own Oracle nodes allowing them to provide their data on-chain without any intermediary to any Decentralized App (dApp) interested by those data.
