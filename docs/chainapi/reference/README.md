Welcome to the ChainAPI deployment README! This guide will explain the various
files contained in the zip file that are required for deploying an Airnode
instance, how they work and what is required from you in order to get up and
running as quickly as possible.

## Requirements

You will need account(s) with the following services before Airnode can be
deployed

- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com)

You will need the following tools installed locally

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Quick start

### Step 1: Create account resources

Create the relevant account and project resources through your preferred cloud
provider(s) web interface. ChainAPI recommends following the
[API3 guides](https://docs.api3.org/airnode/v0.7/grp-providers/docker/deployer-image.html#cloud-provider-credentials).

### Step 2: Populate .env files with secrets

Populate the `.env` file(s) provided with this README with your secrets for your
API and other important accounts. Follow the comments in the files for how to
populate specific keys.

### Step 3: Open a terminal where you saved the files

Open a terminal and change directory to where you extracted these files. This
can be done using the following commands.

#### Windows

Click start, type "cmd" and hit enter. This should open a Command Prompt window.
Type `cd my-folder` to move to the "my-folder" directory. Type `cd ..` to move
up a directory.

#### OSX or Linux

Open a terminal window and type `cd my-folder` to move to the "my-folder"
directory. Type `cd ..` to move up a directory.

### Step 4: Run the Airnode deployer tool

Run the following Docker command based on your current operating system. Follow
any prompts or instructions.

You can more detailed information in the
[API3 Deployment Tutorial](https://docs.api3.org/airnode/v0.7/grp-providers/tutorial/)

#### Windows

```
docker run -it --rm ^
      --env-file aws.env ^
      -v "%cd%/config:/app/config" ^
      -v "%cd%/output:/app/output" ^
      api3/airnode-deployer:0.6.2 deploy
```

#### OSX

```
docker run -it --rm \
      --env-file aws.env \
      -e USER_ID=$(id -u) -e GROUP_ID=$(id -g) \
      -v "$(pwd)/config:/app/config" \
      -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
      api3/airnode-deployer:0.6.2 deploy
```

#### Linux

```
docker run -it --rm \
      --env-file aws.env \
      -e USER_ID=$(id -u) -e GROUP_ID=$(id -g) \
      -v "$(pwd)/config:/app/config" \
      -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
      api3/airnode-deployer:0.6.2 deploy
```

### Step 5: Inspect your Airnode

If successful, your Airnode should now be deployed to your preferred cloud
provider(s)! Log in through the relevant cloud provider account portal and you
should be able to see the deployed Airnode resources. These will be linked to
how the cloud provider "serverless" functions. i.e. For AWS, you will find your
Airnode resources under "Lambda". For GCP, you will find these resources under
"Cloud Functions".

## Files

### config/config.json

**NO USER INPUT REQUIRED**

`config.json` defines a single Airnode and how the node should function. By
default, Airnode does not contain any kind of dynamic database or cache, but the
config.json file can be thought of as a kind of static database provided when
starting the node. Whenever Airnode needs information around things like what
endpoints are available, how they can be called, which blockchains are supported
etc, it will reference the `config.json` file. More dynamic data, such as
account balances and API call requests are fetched directly from the blockchains
themselves. By doing this, Airnode is able to only use a single source of truth
(the blockchain) instead of trying to replicate blockchain data locally which
can very easily become out of sync.

The contents of `config.json` are defined as a JSON file which allows Airnode an
easy way of reading the file. JSON is also human-readable, so you're able to
open this file with any text editor and make any additional configuration
changes. ChainAPI has already provided a fully formed config.json for you that
has been included with this README. `config.json` is blockchain and platform
agnostic and can be re-used for Airnode deployments on any platform.

One important thing to note is that you typically do not want to define any kind
of secret value directly in `config.json`. Secret values are referenced using
the following syntax:

```
"secretKey": "${MY_SECRET_VALUE}"
```

The Airnode deployer tool processes and injects these values in order to store
them securely on your preferred cloud provider(s) such as Amazon Web Services
(AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

https://docs.api3.org/airnode/v0.7/reference/deployment-files/config-json.html

### config/secrets.env

**USER INPUT REQUIRED**

`secrets.env` is a key-value list of secret values that are available to the
Airnode instance. At no point does ChainAPI have access to any of your
application or personal secrets. Also note that you should NEVER share this file
or upload it anywhere that you do not trust to be secure.

By convention, secret keys should be defined as all upper case words, joined
with underscores. Secret values can be in any format and are surrounded by
double quotes when the value contains spaces. Examples:

```
AIRNODE_WALLET_MNEMONIC="achieve climb couple wait accident symbol spy blouse reduce foil echo label"
MY_API_KEY=bba353e9-f9b2-44cb-857b-101537e7ee74
```

This file can also contain comments, using "#". Everything after "#" on the same
line will be ignored and can be used for human-readable explanations.

ChainAPI has provided a template `secrets.env` file included with this README
that contains all of the required (auto-generated) keys for your Airnode
deployment. These keys are based on how you configured your deployment and
integrations through the ChainAPI interface. This file also contains explanatory
comments for each group of secrets.

**Please open the secrets.env file with your preferred text editor and enter the
required secret values**

### aws.env

**USER INPUT REQUIRED**

aws.env is another simple key-value file that defines how the Airnode deployer
tool should authenticate and authorize your account to deploy to AWS. As you
selected to deploy to AWS through the ChainAPI deployment wizard, you will need
to fill out this file in a similar way to secrets.env
