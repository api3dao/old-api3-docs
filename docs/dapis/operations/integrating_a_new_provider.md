When adding data feeds for a new provider, one will generally want to also add
those feeds to the API3 Market.

To add the feeds to the Market, youâ€™ll need to add metadata for those feeds.
These files contain said metadata:

### `/data/explorer/beaconMetadata`

An example from beaconMetadata.json:

```json
{
  "0x0457494ad4d266a6fbdb7906793e311a0d0f0c991a30389ca35ccb0d2b062988": {
    "category": "Stock",
    "pricingCoverage": {
      "polygon": "polygon",
      "polygon-testnet": "test-pricing-set-free",
      "rsk": "rsk",
      "avalanche": "avalanche",
      "avalanche-testnet": "test-pricing-set-free",
      "bsc": "bsc"
    },
    "logos": ["STOCK-GENERIC", "USD"],
    "decimalPlaces": 2,
    "prefix": "$"
  }
}
```

### `/data/explorer/commonLogos.json`

Many data feeds will reference two or more logos. These logos usually overlap
between feeds, hence commonLogos.json:

```json
{
  "AAVE": "https://api3-market.pages.dev/images/asset-logos/AAVE.webp",
  "ADA": "https://api3-market.pages.dev/images/asset-logos/ADA.webp",
  "ALPACA": "https://api3-market.pages.dev/images/asset-logos/ALPACA.webp",
  "ATOM": "https://api3-market.pages.dev/images/asset-logos/ATOM.webp"
}
```

The logo names are referenced in beaconMetadata, as per the example above.

The actual logos are stored in the API3 Market repository; logos are small and
Cloudflare does a good job of distributing them. You can find the source logos
here:

### `/data/explorer/dapiMetadata.json`

dAPIs in the Market carry potentially different pricing compared to the data
feeds they point to, and so this is defined in the above file. An example:

```json
{
  "JOE/USD": {
    "pricingCoverage": {
      "polygon": "polygon",
      "polygon-testnet": "test-pricing-set-free",
      "rsk": "rsk",
      "avalanche": "avalanche",
      "avalanche-testnet": "test-pricing-set-free",
      "bsc": "bsc"
    }
  }
}
```

`/data/dapis/*.json`

dapis are explicitly defined in operations and the Market uses these mappings.
An example:

```json
{
  "ADA/USD": "0x8dd297503e6e8b95c979677e9e6aecfee08ee5426bea72adff2d7a797f7bd69d",
  "AXS/USD": "0x2b6c4fdf87eb7e4321115c5e04dc6dd2ae3a4e83f443c1c9f493eaa98b192a59",
  "DOT/USD": "0xc8d57dc4972714cc8754fda28fdd824faf63607b26fa7bc895006400c7298093"
}
```
