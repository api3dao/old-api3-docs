Smart contract developers now have access to dAPIs through the new
[API3 Market](https://market.api3.org), where data feeds are easily searched,
monitored, and consumed. For a limited time, dAPIs are free to use. Projects can
integrate now to maximize their access to high quality price data during this
free trial period. Visit the
[Request Data](https://forms.monday.com/forms/embed/f44d0ed9dfd0154885f48fdb3b87a489?r=use1)
form to get access.
