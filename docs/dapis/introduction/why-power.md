Third-party oracle solutions whitelabel existing APIs, relay their data as
middlemen and extract an amount of rent that reaches billions of dollars in
total. This results in a non-transparent, costly service that is open to
middlemen attacks and inefficiencies. More importantly, third-party oracle
solutions cannibalize revenue that API providers could have generated first-hand
on Web3.

API3 builds API provider-centric oracle solutions. These services are provided
directly by the API provider to the data consumer, with no middlemen. As a
result, they enable unmatched security and source transparency in a
cost-efficient manner. Cutting out the rent-seeking middlemen in this way allows
API providers to monetize their services on Web3 effectively.

dAPIs are _first-party_, API provider-centric versions of live data feeds, which
are typically used in Web3 applications of financial nature. By directly
providing continuously updated streams of off-chain data called _Beacons_, API
providers can power dAPIs. For this, the API provider needs to own and operate
an <router-link :to="$themeConfig.latestVersions.airnode">Airnode</router-link>,
which is configured to power Beacons that are the building blocks of dAPIs. API3
builds the solutions that are used in this process, and guides API providers in
utilizing them.

API3 operates dAPIs on a number of chains and actively works on building new
integrations and business relations. This means the API provider does not need
to invest technical or business development resources into this newly-emerging
yet lucrative field, or possess any blockchain know-how to reap the benefits.
