Beacons allow smart contract developers to connect Web3 applications to
continuously updated streams of off-chain data, such as the latest
cryptocurrency, stock, and commodities prices. Beacon are light-weight,
first-party data feeds that increase transparency, reduce cost, and scale data
access for Web3.

Why power Beacons? API providers are in the business to monetize their data and
on-chain Beacons make it possible. Smart contract developers are demanding
on-chain data at affordable pricing and Beacons are the easy solution.

## Beacons are everywhere!

Operated by the market’s most trusted and reliable data providers, Beacons are a
transparent, cost-efficient, and scalable way for smart contracts to interact
with data they need.

Beacons are literally everywhere and data from API providers will get maximum
exposure to dApps that &ndash; run wherever. The simple design and
implementation makes it easy for API3 to deploy its Beacon server contract on
compatible evm chains. API providers simply deploy an Airnode (_API provider
owned and operated_) and instantly present their Beacon data on the blockchains
of their choosing.

## Reasons to power Beacons

Beacons are designed for API providers big and small and create a new
marketplace for them. Implementation costs are minimal and API3 is ready to
help.

### Monetize

With attractive pricing of Beacons, developers are now building smart contracts
that consume off-chain data they could not previously afford. API providers
stand to profit from this explosion of data hungry dApps.

### Pricing

Traditional Web3 data feeds rely on networks of 3rd-party oracle nodes. Built on
API3’s first-party oracles, Beacons cut out the middlemen and the hefty fees
they collect. In doing so API provider data is attractively priced.

### Exposure

By engaging the emerging Web3 market for Beacons, API providers gain exposure
for their organizations. API providers that power Beacons on many blockchains
will establish a reputation as premier data providers.

### Security

Beacons are fed directly from the API provider to the blockchain. There are no
3rd-party oracle nodes in the middle to attack. Developers of dApps know exactly
where their data came from. This insures a level of comfort that other 3rd-party
data feeds cannot offer.

### Reputation

When data comes directly from a reputable source, the provider’s off-chain
reputation comes with it. Using "first-party" sourced data for their Beacons
says a lot about an API provider.

### Transparency

API3 Beacons provide an API provider with a completely transparent model to
place their data on-chain. More transparency means more selectivity and
security. Developers of dApps have come to trust and believe in the API3 DAO for
its transparent practices. The code and the parameters used to bring _off-chain_
data _on-chain_ is 100% open source. Beacons offer dApp developers a level of
comfort that black-boxed third-party data feeds cannot.

### Scalability

Beacons are light-weight and highly scalable. Scale up for high performance
chains. Scale down for a wide range of use cases that aren’t feasible with
traditional data feeds.
