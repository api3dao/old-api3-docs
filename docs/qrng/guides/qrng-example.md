The [qrng-example](https://github.com/api3dao/qrng-example) project (GitHub
repo) demonstrates how to build a smart contract (known as a requester) using
the Airnode requestâ€“response protocol to receive QRNG services. It is
recommended to run the example project to learn how it uses the QRNG service on
a testnet, and read the associated README file. It also contains example code
that will be useful when creating a requester (smart contract) that requests a
random number.

- [qrng-example/contracts/](https://github.com/api3dao/qrng-example/tree/main/contracts)
  - `QrngExamples.sol`: A sample requester used to call the QRNG service.
- [qrng-example/deploy/](https://github.com/api3dao/qrng-example/tree/main/deploy)
  - `deploy.js`: Script that deploys a requester to a chain.
  - `setup.js`: Script that sets the parameters on the requester contract. These
    parameters are used when calling the QRNG service.
  - `fund.js`: Script that funds the wallet the requester uses to pay the gas
    costs.

::: tip Gas Costs

Using the QRNG service is free, meaning there is no subscription fee to pay.
There is a gas cost incurred on-chain when Airnode places the random number
on-chain in response to a request, which the requester needs to pay for.

## Sponsor Wallet

The QRNG example project
[sets the sponsor wallet](https://github.com/api3dao/qrng-example/blob/main/deploy/2_setup.js#L11-L28)
using the requester address. The wallet is then used to pay gas costs when the
Airnode responds to a request. An alternate method is to use the
[Admin CLI](/airnode/v0.7/reference/packages/admin-cli.md) as is the case with
the [Remix Example Project](./remix-example.md).
